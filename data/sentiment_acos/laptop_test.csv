2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os .,0

all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad .,-1
my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it .,-1

"6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings .",1
"so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `",1
after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working .,-1
it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds .,1
i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off .,1
it seems put together well .,1
+ decent quantity of available ports,1
+ it has a dvd drive : o,0
- it runs hot !,-1
"running grid benchmark , it got to a high 92 / 93 degrees c !",-1

i ' ve been using it for at least 4 hours since last charged in that 23 % used up .,1
"- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this .",-1
- easily upgradeable ram,1
one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard .,1
"it ' s not fancy , but it ' s good value and fast and trouble - free .",1
"after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful .",1
easily upgrade to storage and ram .,1
this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs .,0
"i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds .",1
it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming .,1
"it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds .",1
i am very impressed with this system .,1
mastercam itself runs pretty good .,1
as usual amazon was great about returning it .,1
"screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished .",1
i like the back lit keyboard .,1
it ' s a lot of good for a comparatively cheap price .,1
the screen is perfectly adequate .,1
this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful .,1
google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate .,1
"i would highly recommend this to anyone , but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable , easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet .",1
i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome .,1
this thing is still fantastic for what it is .,1
i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 .,1
i couldn ' t be happier with this product !,1
the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it .,1

"works great right out of the box , as advertised .",1
the battery life on this seems good .,1
this chromebook instantly connects to the internet .,1

"also , secure os .",1
the product itself is awesome .,1
great little laptop and tablet !,1

"however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with .",1
love the keyboard .,1
i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !,1
i am so glad i purchased this and would definitely purchase again .,1
since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too .,1
great for going on the internet .,1
it works well for her .,1
we ran world of tank blitz ( using a game controller ) and roblocks on the low rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play .,1
another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud .,-1
love it,1
great battery life .,1
easy to take with and do homework on the go too !,1
i would recommend it to anyone .,1
this is perfect .,1

"nice , i ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use .",1
i love my chromebook .,1

laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy .,1
"the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that .",-1
"it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done .",1
"nice and thin , light , surprised it has a dvd player in it .",1
mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month .,-1
fast processor .,1
if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !,1
i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu .,-1
this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart .,1
"the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !",1
has all the available ports that i need .,1
laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board .,1

i bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills .,0
really like it .,1
played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag .,1
webpages load quickly .,1
"but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all .",0
"for us , it was perfect .",1
i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good .,1
i love how sleek and thin it is .,1
great feel to the keyboard as well .,1
this is a super fast computer and i really like it .,1
it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school .,1
"i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off .",-1
"i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life .",0
"battery life is short , but plugging it in works .",-1
sleek design .,1
easy to use .,1
nice computer for responsible grade school child .,1
this laptop is well engineered and designed .,1
this is a very nice laptop .,1
it is perfect for everything i need it for .,1
provided just what i wanted at a resonable price .,1
this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems .,1
it is a little slow .,-1
"great computer , setup was fast and easy .",1
"i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 .",1
graphics are good for the level of this laptop .,1
finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months .,-1
plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months .,-1
i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect .,-1
"the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution .",1
"after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go .",0
"idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying .",-1
"i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on .",-1
the touch screen works wonderfully .,1
"as others have noted , the backspace key is small .",-1
my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable .,-1
"hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life .",-1
"needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?",-1
"gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was .",1
"this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair .",0
i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops .,-1
"look , dont buy it .",-1
the screen does look good .,1
terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore .,-1
battery life its ok .,0
"then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke .",-1
"another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time .",-1
"i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time .",-1
"battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it .",0
amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired .,0
"battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great .",1
there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet .,-1
unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !,-1
sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure .,-1
the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations .,-1
"when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook .",1
"at $ 300 , this is a great purchase .",1
"which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `",1
this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it .,1
"it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use .",1
"the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work .",1
"this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past .",1
"when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer .",-1
i love it !,1
"this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop .",1
the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use .,1
"overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs .",1
my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy .,1
little bit of a learning curve with chrome os .,-1
so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time .,-1
"chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default .",-1
"the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !",-1
the initial feel for this chromebook is superb .,1
the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score .,1
"this is a solid , well - balanced design .",1
"first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever .",1
i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks .,1
"as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think .",1
"i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine .",1
"secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine .",1
"there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model .",0
"secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate .",-1
the battery is good .,1
"if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one .",1
i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office .,0
battery seems to be pretty good .,1
"with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy .",-1
this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc .,0
it does everything that i need and is surprisingly fast .,1
i want to cry because this doesn ' t support google play store !,-1
i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all .,1
this is a huge plus !,1
- drives are now solid state drive .,0
- new built - in speakers .,1
- no dvd drive .,-1
"i couldn ' t drag - and - drop items in it , but after i changed the behavior in settings , everything went well from there .",0
it is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop .,1
very sharp screen and good viewing angles .,1
something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match .,1
no complaints here .,1
this computer is blazing fast .,1
"with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant .",1
the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time .,1
this thing is fast and efficient .,1
"this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it .",1
"the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter .",1
the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp .,1
the best laptop i ' ve owned .,1
bought it for my grandson for college and he loves it .,1
"overall , this is an excellent machine .",1
"good durability , outstanding performance and portability .",1
response is excellent .,1
- battery life appears to be excellent,1
- laptop is light .,1
- generous selection of ports ( this is in reference to the newer model ),1
"- laptop is sleek and dare i say , sexy",1
i enjoy the processing speed of this model .,1
"fast shipping , product exactly as described , authentic apple , new , factory sealed in box .",1
loving the sharp display and the track pad .,1
i am in love with how light and speedy it is .,1
i love this macbook .,1
great product,1
this is an amazing computer i bought from cellelectronics .,1
they put a lot of thought and work into making sure that the hardware and software work real well together .,1
obviously great computer,1
"very nice laptop , i love its portable feature and the running speed is very fast .",1
the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life .,-1
"it is thinner , and lighter .",1
awesome computer .,1
the shipping was fast and the seller was great,1
the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing .,1
love this computer !,1
"force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome .",1
works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous .,1
the laptop arrived in excellent condition .,1
"i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac .",1
"battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description .",-1
this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it .,1
"if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence .",1
the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives .,1
it ' s far away from meeting my expectations .,-1
i really like how it isn ' t bulky .,1
great price and customer service,1
"however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises .",1
awesome machine .,1
costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market .,1
"this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life .",1
great price .,1
great computer !,1
i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer .,1
great prodcut,1
i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector .,-1
shipping was fast and product came as described .,1
apple updates are easy .,1
"it arrived in great condition , and it ' s been working perfectly for me since i got it .",1
high quaility computer in every way .,1
i like this machine quite a bit .,1
"i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update .",-1
"took a week or so to get used to , but love it now .",1
screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen .,0
battery : solid .,1
"i mean , if you want a true tablet , buy a true tablet - - this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as i was planning to .",-1
"i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) .",1
update it as soon as you turn it on !,0
my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new .,0
"however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage .",1
"the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice .",1
people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box .,1
"so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available .",1
maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection .,-1
"and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want .",0
it does make quite a loud click when you depress the button .,-1
"overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) .",1
one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !,1
"i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews .",-1
due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this .,1
i downloaded pandora and listened to all my stations at 3 / 4 volume and it sounded fine .,1
"so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly .",1
laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) .,-1
i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer,-1
"i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services .",-1
"but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing .",1
"ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working .",-1
the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t .,-1
update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together .,-1
"while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up .",1
do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) .,-1
"as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now .",1
the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty .,-1
the macbook pro offers a very dependable machine that will muddle - through anything you throw at it without complaining .,1
2 usb ports and 2 thunderbolt ports on a $ 4500nz laptop ?,-1
the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable .,-1
the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot .,-1
"first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !",1
i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews .,1
"the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on .",1
it ' s not stated anywhere that ' s it ' s used .,-1
didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars .,-1
"then one day , it stopped booting .",-1
my daughter loves it and it will be a great tool to help her through nursing school .,1
apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore .,-1
* very good battery life,1
it is not worth it .,-1
"i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality .",-1
i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase .,1
"after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a ‘ one - off ' .",-1
"asus , has a horrible reputation .",-1
my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us .,-1
"bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp .",1
"- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it .",1
- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming .,1
"i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year .",1
"- in tablet mode , the screen looks too ‘ tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) .",0
this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode .,1
after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge .,-1
"if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device .",1
second issue is with scaling of the ui .,-1
the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution .,-1
"unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud .",-1
• great battery life .,1
• volume is incredibly low .,-1
i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook .,1
then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook .,-1
it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet .,-1
transfer speeds ( lan to nas ) were miserably slow ( 10 - 30mbps ) .,-1
"it was perfect with no backlight bleed , no shimmery matte texture , no uneven backlight , no dead / stuck pixels .",1
i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue .,-1
"if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable .",-1
some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os .,-1
"the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use .",1
even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get .,1
the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers .,-1
this is the problem with companies today .,-1
asus customer service sucks .,-1
"i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year .",-1
"it is a beautiful , well built laptop .",1
that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product .,-1
asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?,-1
now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing .,-1
very impressed with my first chromebook .,1
i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration .,-1
i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews .,1
google docs work fine .,1
"a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming .",1
"second , and most annoying , it would not identify my printer in cloud print .",-1
"so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless .",-1
"product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !",1
i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky .,-1
"not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so .",-1
and not buy any asus product again,-1
the third one is ok but has a dead pixel .,0
i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response .,-1
this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal .,-1
several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience .,-1
"however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible .",-1
battery life is not good .,-1
but screen is very weird .,-1
"the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps .",1
i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable .,1
hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable .,1
battery no longer charging .,-1
"furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use .",-1
the display panel on the machine i received is warped .,-1
half the time it doesn ' t want to turn on and just flashes .,-1
"in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged .",-1
the screen hinge feels weak .,-1
screen is average by 2017 standards .,0
the chromebook is brilliant overall .,1
google provides zeros customer support related to the os .,-1
horrible product .,-1
tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return .,-1
i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook .,-1
it freezes constantly and needs to be shut off to start again .,-1
the microphone does not work with regular speaker .,-1
the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications .,-1
i tried returning the second one bu it does n ' t give me the option to return it .,-1
this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities .,1
overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there .,1
"however , mine came with an annoying trackpad .",-1
the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable .,-1
"mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term .",-1
"however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port .",-1
so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service,-1
they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen .,-1
i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc .,-1
"the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard .",1
the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic .,-1
1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger .,-1
i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen .,-1
"however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great .",1
the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage .,-1
"i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop .",0
trackpad is ok .,0
wireless card is finicky with both units i had .,-1
my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times .,-1
"after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced .",-1
run like heck from this machine .,-1
"it will break , even if it works at first .",-1
this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet .,-1
"literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop .",-1
hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for .,1
"by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi .",-1
"i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price .",1
the sound is really terrible and tinny .,-1
it ' s fast .,1
excellent product,1
i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price .,1
it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery .,-1
"so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting .",-1
"for the four days i used it , it worked pretty good .",1
this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money .,-1
we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping .,-1
i am extremely disappointed with this laptop .,-1
update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased .,-1
"got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing .",-1
this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware .,-1
poor design and terrible tech support .,-1
this computer is amazing !,1
"quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset .",1
"not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop .",-1
this laptop was great starting out of the box .,1
"their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful .",-1
sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue .,-1
after this issue i finally decided to return my product .,-1
good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you .,-1
i ' ve had to do a factory reset on this piece of garbage 4 times and i ' ve only owned it for 4 months .,-1
you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand .,-1
i really loved this laptop .,1
i will never own another msi product .,-1
"now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere .",-1
so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work .,-1
eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product .,-1
when it is functioning it works great .,-1
finding out you bought garbage for the steep price of $ 700 + .,-1
laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months .,-1
"it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast .",1
the keyboard is very nice and very responsive .,1
"i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd .",1
the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours .,-1
had it for a month and it ' s riddled with problems .,-1
"as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive .",-1
"+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness .",1
"used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) .",0
- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall ),-1
no backlit keyboard .,-1
it has plenty of power for most tasks .,1
"the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m .",1
"i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal .",1
"also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off .",-1
haven ' t had any issues yet so pretty glad i chose this .,1
very nice looking laptop for the money .,1
"features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m .",1
great quality computer .,1
"like the flip , this has good build quality .",1
so far it has been able to handle everything i ' ve thrown at it .,1
"all in all , pretty good stuff .",1
2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 .,1
very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing .,1
"excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 .",1
"so , shortly after buying it i had to format it .",-1
"and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging .",-1
the fingerprint reader works most of the time .,1
the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers .,1
not that this machine boots up slow .,-1
great value for a laptop .,1
love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body .,1
touchpad works well .,1
the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position .,0
"i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open .",1
"i like how it ' s so simple , without so much clutter and complexity .",1
i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price .,1
"anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester .",1
"laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours .",-1
i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek .,1
it ' s decent .,1
ssd hardware issue,-1
"note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service",1
the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake .,-1
daughter opened it for christmas and it doesn ' t stay on .,-1
they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size .,1
i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again .,-1
i will give them props for the build quality .,-1
combine these items together and this item became very frustrating .,-1
- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel,1
"- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 .",-1
as you can see from the reviews it worked out fine for most people .,1
when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it .,-1
"by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot .",-1
now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop .,1
good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down .,1
"i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters .",1
the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price .,1
can not remove the battery .,-1
i too have the black screen problem .,-1
"won ' t turn on , won ' t charge , have to send it to tx to be repaired .",-1
"i want to insist that this is not a game laptop , as many have reviewed it as .",0
battery life can last me roughly 5 or 6 hours on internet usage alone with multiple tabs .,0
the speakers on the bottom take a moment to get used to but after that it ' s alright .,0
"also , i hate the keyboard - it feels really cheap .",-1
mx150 gaphics card is also pretty bad .,-1
"and i genuinely believed in acer , but first i had a lot of issues setting up the computer and after hours of customer service help the touch pad did n ' t even work .",-1
i took it to my local computer repair who states it has a bad board .,-1
there ' s something wrong with my laptop .,-1
something is wrong with the power management .,-1
"very disappointed in the $ 600 e 15 , as opposed to the no frills , plain old , < $ 200 15 i ' ve had for 2 .",-1
the trackpad stopped working after four weeks of using it .,-1
there is a flicker in the middle of the screen that is very annoying .,-1
the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps .,-1
"otherwise , so far it is working well .",1
i presented my son with a gift of a defective machine .,-1
"the computer itself is actually quite fast with the ssd and processor , so my experience there so far has been good .",1
keyboard and track pad shoved way left .,-1
keyboard rattles loudly when typing on left side .,-1
"will not connect to wifi , amd screen flashes when adjusting while on .",-1
but the speakers are absolutely horrible !,-1
latest 8th generation core i5 cpu,1
keyboard has flex,0
no backlight at keyboard,-1
key presses are too stiff to press .,-1
hdd makes this laptop very slow .,-1
but asus engineers designed the case and laptop not to be opened by users .,-1
there is no backlight and keys are too stiff .,-1
i believe it is not healthy to use this keyboard for a long time .,-1
linux is mostly compatible with this laptop except fingerprint reader .,-1
video converting process with same video file took only 25 minutes with asus vivobook f510ua .,1
3 ) you can hear the screen creak .,-1
it doesn ' t support a hardwire connection .,0
i have installed no software on it yet it updates something every day and wants to reboot .,-1
it just locked up again .,-1
did i mention it sounds like a lawn mower ?,-1
"i will say i do enjoy the screen quality , the wifi is fast on this laptop .",1
"in all , stay away .",-1
- keyboard is comfortable to use,1
- finger doesn ' t side smoothly along track pad .,-1
horrible laptop !,-1
i had to spend over $ 160 to return it .,-1
i will never buy an other asus product .,-1
"it just crashed , dead .",-1
"- the screen looks pretty good , except when viewing anything dark .",1
- the keyboard is awful .,-1
"when i asked asus for a replacement key , they said i ' d have to ship it back to them , which would have left me without a computer for 2 weeks .",0
don ' t buy it .,-1
after my 3rd boot up it ' s damaged .,-1
"after a month of use , disk ( c : ) runs at 100 % all the time .",-1
everything else is very good and i am satisfied,1
"do not buy this computer if your plan is to multitask , play an occasional game and / or play music while searching the web .",-1
"this is first impression , 1st day using it",0
overall good laptop .,1
the fingerprint scanner is half jotted and barely works .,-1
one day of use and the screen turns itself off and logs you out whenever it feels to do so .,-1
finger print scanner not working whatsoever .,-1
"poor touch pad , it get stuck .",-1
- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine,1
"- user interfaces that are tight , responsive",1
"all and all , it ' s a light weight , but very robust development stack , that also has the added convenience of cloud9 ' s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously .",1
"thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well .",1
"mouse and trackpad settings are very minimalist , there ' s no way to modify short - cut keys , and the power management options are pretty minimal , too .",-1
and the google play store is chock - full of great apps and games .,1
it ' s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different linux configs and environments effortless .,1
"you won ' t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it , and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer .",1
"for ~ $ 15 you can get a nice , fitted anti - glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint / glare problems and gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen .",1
i saw this c302 was announced at ces and was immediately drawn to it since it has the intel core m3 processor .,1
"apps like microsoft word , excel , etc run wonderfully .",1
"for instance , the android youtube app doesn ' t work well at all because it ' s very inconvenient to get videos into full - screen mode .",-1
it seems pretty fast .,1
so i ' m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302 .,1
this is easily the best overall chromebook out there right now ( under $ 500 ) .,1
* battery * - battery life is great .,1
the backlight works great and i had no problems using it in the dark .,1
it ' s a nice smooth surface so no tension when gliding across it .,1
multi - touch input works great .,1
* build quality * - i ' m really pleased with the overall quality .,1
it ' s light enough to carry pretty much every where .,1
"it starts up , runs without issues .",0
even the speakers are way better than i expected from a 2 in 1 at this price point .,1
"this is finally the chromebook i ' ve been waiting for , that is not a $ 1300 pixel .",1
- the screen has great contrast and is glossy and sharp,1
- this may be a personal preference but i did wish the screen was a tad bit brighter .,-1
overall great chromebook .,1
this is a spectacular chromebook .,1
"it ' s faster , the screen is much nicer , and it has twice the memory and four times the drive space .",1
"the core m3 processor allows the c302 to be fanless , as well , adding to the sleek design .",1
"it ' s a real timesaver , honestly .",1
i find the display sharp and touch responsive to be quite excellent .,1
at the end of the day i think it is worth the extra cost if you are looking for a premium product feel .,1
"- nice , bright screen ( touchscreen , too ! )",1
battery doesn ' t last nearly as long as advertised .,-1
this is a very cleverly designed and fast machine .,1
operational speed - - likely the fastest laptop i have ever used ( for basic functions ) .,1
edit 2 : 8 months in and everything is working great .,1
- trackpad isn ' t the best .,0
"- the touch screen isn ' t as accurate as i wish , for cases like tapping tiny things around the edges .",-1
- the screen size is an awkward 16 : 9 and provides a 1920x1080 resolution ( although the default is set to 1536x864 ) .,-1
"for 99 % of the people looking at chromebooks right now for personal use , this asus is probably the best choice in the market .",1
"overall , i am extremely impressed with this chromebook and would highly recommend this to others .",1
it works well as a tablet .,1
it works great as a laptop and for the things i do which tend to be web based .,1
"nevertheless , i did have my own nitpicking issues with it but for the $ 250 price tag it launched with , it was well worth it .",1
"i found the display to be very vibrant , with excellent pixel density .",1
i like the dispersion of ports and feel it helps with the ergonomics of your daily usage .,1
"still , for $ 450 i ' m a huge fan of the screen and the excellent overall build quality .",1
"and even with all of the new competition hitting the market with higher price points , the c302 still offers the best premium chrome os experience at a respectable price .",1
the screen is fantastic .,1
the mousepad feels very comfortable to use .,1
the battery performance is all it ' s cracked up to be .,1
"the sound is rich and plenty loud enough , but it won ' t replace your music system .",-1
backlit allow even guys with large hands to use this keyboard comfortably in any lighting .,1
the trackpad and touchscreen are both excellent .,1
the speaker sound is ok but not great .,0
i really do love this chromebook because it provides a large amount of utility and is perfect for a university setting and environment .,1
"* the usb - c ports are working well , and i bought a multiple port adapter , which gives me a regular usb port along with a hdmi port an another usb - c port for charging .",1
speaker : good speakers but not the loudest .,1
the device is so sturdy and clean looking it is a pleasure to hold in my hands .,1
the touchscreen is very responsive and works great in tablet mode .,1
the battery life is touted as 10 hours but i find that 7 .,-1
this is a fantastic chromebook .,1
- single battery charge can last 13 - 9 hours depending on wifi / video / app demand,1
i love this chromebook .,1
"the touchscreen works very well , and android apps are working right now if you ' re on the beta channel for chrome os .",1
i love this chromebook !,1
/ / really love this device .,1
i really like the keyboard .,1
the only drawback to the device so far is that it ' s not especially comfortable to use in tablet mode ; the edges of the bezel are little too ` ` sharp ` ` to comfortably rest your palms and at 2 .,-1
"as a laptop , this is just the size i need .",1
"the keyboard is often - praised , but i don ' t find it particularly spectacular .",1
"it is very light , and it seems surprisingly sturdy .",1
the battery life seems just as promised .,0
"the keyboard is comfortable to type on , although i haven ' t done so for more than a 1 - 2 hours .",1
the screen is clear and bright and the system doesn ' t lag unless i have a large number of tabs open .,1
"first , use case : i write a lot for work and use a chromebook as my daily driver for notes , word processing , spreadsheets , etc .",0
battery last incredibly long .,1
it found and connected to my wireless printer also with no problems .,1
this is exactly what i wanted .,1
i now feel like this could be my main computer for work and fun .,1
give the asus flip 302 consideration .,1
its battery life is quite good and the keyboard experience is great .,1
the plugs are good and bad .,0
i plugged in regular headphones and it was horribly low - very unenjoyable to listen to music this way .,-1
"nice sized keyboard , works great as a tablet ( even shuts off the keyboard in tablet mode ) .",1
this machine is far better than anything i ' ve ever owned .,1
perfect size to use in bed and nice and bright .,1
i don ' t think you ' ll find a better laptop at this price point .,1
it ' s super thin and super light .,1
"as a traveler , this fits in my backpack without all the added weight of a small 13 ` ` laptop .",1
it is very light in weight but feels quite durable and strong .,1
the picture quality is very good and the book itself is responsive and fast .,1
i can ' t recommend the asus c302 enough .,1
the keyboard itself is probably the one physical weak point .,-1
the touchscreen works well .,1
"but , it does work and is handy .",1
it ' s very light and sitting on the couch typing this is comfortable .,1
sound is really low while using an aux speaker / headphone .,-1
spacebar doesn ' t always accept input,-1
this is my favorite computer of all the ones i have ever owned .,1
the battery life is stunning .,1
i ' ve just gotten started so this review may evolve over time but after several days i ' m insanely satisfied with this purchase and am going to be showing off to my friends for the foreseeable future .,1
this chromebook is one of the best computers i ' ve ever used .,1
"the asus chromebook flip 302ca is smooth , fast and incredibly well engineered and built .",1
the screen resolution is great .,1
the touch pad is accurate .,1
my only gripe is that i wish there was a way to default the screen brightness as well as default the keyboard backlight to off .,-1
at a $ 500 price tag for a chromebook i was a little hesitant to pull the trigger but at this point i am very pleased with the purchase and i believe it is worth the price .,1
it ' s really nice to have the touchscreen when using apps and i can seamlessly transition back to using the trackpad / keyboard depending on what i ' m doing .,1
keyboard is comfortable and screen is sharp .,1
its very portable and battery should last full day of normal usage .,1
i truly love this chromebook .,1
"the touch screen is really accurate , and the 360 flip feature is really easy - i can switch to tablet mode anytime , although i use this much more often as a laptop .",1
"the pros definitely outweigh the cons , earning this chromebook 5 stars .",1
"great computer , especially for the price .",1
- two usb - c for charging ( no more odd angles ! ),1
- price is a bit expensive for a chromebook,-1
"it ' s perfect for school , surfing the web , and watching videos .",1
"i really love the laptop , it is exactly what i wanted and expected in the price range and i ' m super happy with it !",1
it feels and performs mighty solid as a laptop .,1
the wifi connectivity is strong and consistent in my experience .,1
the only thing i didn ' t like is the screen isn ' t bright enough and the speakers aren ' t louder .,-1
"c302ca - dh54 gets the job done for work that doesn ' t require multiple cores for rendering , weight painting or ripping .",1
the graphics are great .,1
i ' m in college right new studying information technology and it ' s been able to do everything i ' ve needed .,1
"the only drawback is that it does not run the native android versions of microsoft office , and they should warn you about that .",-1
this has met and exceeded my expectations .,1
"this is a small , well built product ideal for general usage .",1
the screen resolution is also very good when watching movies or viewing photos .,1
i would highly recommend this !,1
"i love the backlight , it ' s not so bright as to blind you at night time .",1
"speaker ' s are ok but not amazing , i do like that they are mounted on the sides so they work well in laptop or tablet mode equally well .",1
"being able to use play store apps has been a huge plus and i ' m now so comfortable with google docs , i ' very already forgotten i even owned a windows laptop .",1
but this screen is really good and the keyboard and form factor are much better .,1
"i really enjoy the 2 - 1 aspect of the device and really like how when folded into tablet mode , there aren ' t any weird groves on the sides .",1
"the computer itself is not bad , the 360 rotation and touch screen feel good .",1
battery life is amazing .,1
very good purchase .,1
"in laptop form , it ' s mediocre at best .",0
"this chromebook is really one of the best you can own , in my opinion one of the best laptops in general !",1
the battery life is great and i love the touchscreen / flip feature .,1
audio quest dragonfly is automatically detected and runs perfectly when attached to one of the usb - c ports .,1
the keyboard is backlit and big enough for my fingers .,1
"i love everything about this laptop , the keyboard , screen resolution , and speed .",1
"the battery lasts at least 8 - 9 hours using it to type notes and simple web browsing , making it perfect for students .",1
"it is quick , battery lasts a long time and certainly does what i need it to do ( which is web surfing multiple pages at the same time while having a few ms documents open ) .",1
"it ' s a clean , mean , lean , machine .",1
the switch has been awesome .,1
the backlit keyboard is awesome at night .,1
keyboard was a little confusing .,-1
screen display is bright and has excellent graphics .,1
