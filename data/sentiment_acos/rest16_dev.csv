impressed . . .,1
subtle food and service,1

amazing food .,1
"rather than preparing vegetarian dish , the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables ( minus sauce , seasoning , or any form or aesthetic presentation ) .",-1

the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced .,1

"however , our $ 14 drinks were were horrible !",-1
"once we finally got a table , despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed !",-1
i do n ' t appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron ' s knowledge so that was a huge turnoff ( more than the price ) .,-1
eat at your own risk .,-1

the sake ’ s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .,1

i had the lamb special which was perfect .,1
