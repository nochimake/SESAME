acer wants $ 170 to just look at it then add the repair cost on top of that .,0
update : i repaired it myself for $ 12 .,0
i had nothing to lose since it was a paper weight otherwise .,-1
the shame of it is knowing it took me 15 minutes and $ 12 to fix it and acer wanted to rob me of $ 170 just to look at it .,-1
"first one that they shipped was obviously defective , super slow and speakers were garbled .",-1
"the replacement i got was much better , but still too slow for my expectations .",-1
i wound up returning it .,-1
this works fine for that .,1
"october 12 , 2017 - - started having trouble maintaining connection to wifi ( spectrum service ) , but usually after several loops re - entering password , connection would be re - established .",-1
"sometimes had to do several times , but thought it might be an idiosyncrady of this model .",-1
i just got this thing today & was really excited about it but this has been frustrating & disappointing .,-1
i ' ll wait a while until this device gets 4 - 5 stars .,0
there are certain very basic tasks that this computer can do .,-1
"a lot of websites don ' t work properly with the chromebook , even though you ' re using the same browser .",-1
"overall , this thing can do very basic stuff , sometimes .",0
"pro : light , reasonable price , fast .",1
keyboard key fragile .,-1
after 6 months my eyboard key is not function very well .,-1
"i only use the chormebook for surving the internet , checking my email , and watch hulu or netflix .",0
this is something to reconsidered if one to buy the chromebook for doing homework and a lot of typing .,0
"up date per may 13 / 2018 about two months ago , the charger wont work .",-1
so latest update the charger only last about one year and the half .,-1
"overall , it is not horrible , but i wouldn ' t purchase this model again .",-1
- long battery life,1
- charges quickly,1
- screen feels smaller than other of the same size .,-1
it gets two stars because it is a nice light weight and the folding is nice .,1
two replacements had the same problem all in 4 weeks .,-1
i already returned the first laptop because i had to press extremely hard to get the left click to work .,-1
"i ' ve had the device for 4 days now , and it has a number of big issues .",-1
"next , is that the track pad is insanely wobbly .",-1
one of the worst offenders is the battery life .,-1
it also refuses to charge past 90 % and instantly jumps to 80 % when i unplug it .,-1
"there are issues beyond these , but it ' s all software related so i will let it be .",-1
"within two days of receiving this item a line appeared on my screen ( while i was using it , previously fine ) and below it the image / screen flickered .",-1
"the flip and touchscreen aspects work fine , no problems .",1
it can not .,-1
"screen looks good , it has a good battery life , keypad has some nice feedback , the works .",1
but you can ' t use an acer chromebook r 11 this way .,-1
and the chromebook does not go to sleep or otherwise shut off .,-1
loved it for an hour than it went black and we got a chrome os missing or damage message .,-1
terrible product and worse customer service - - do not buy,-1
we ordered this chromebook for my son to use for school .,0
"we received it in august , and it worked fine for just 5 months and then the touch screen stopped working .",-1
"it worked properly for less than a week , and the touch screen stopped functioning again .",-1
"we contacted both acer and amazon , and they both informed us that it has to be sent back for repairs again .",0
good display,1
good battery life,1
"build quality seems ok , keyboard is not flimsy or too firm .",1
my understanding is that chromeos is a very light weight so i don ' t know why it lags sometimes with under 10 tabs open and a youtube video playing .,1
i needed a small chromebook for light web use while traveling and this tablet does ok but considering the price i would have expected a better processor and keyboard lighting .,-1
"my main complaint is the battery life , i see many positive reviews about the battery life .",-1
i just find the battery draining to quickly in my opinion .,-1
i tried messing around in the dev mode to adjust the microphone sensitivity but nothing seems to work .,-1
"plug - in or usb microphones seem to work fine , so it ' s not a terribly big issue and i don ' t really even use a microphone that often , but it ' s annoying to buy a product and not have it working .",-1
the broken mic was not a dealbreaker but annoying in a brand new device .,-1
"in addition , in my short time using the device , i realized how much i dislike having fingerprints on my computer screen .",-1
microphone is not really working ( you have to basically yell while alsmost touching it with you lips in order for someone else to hear you ) .,-1
when switching between tablet and laptop mode quickly the screen will blink and turn off for an extended period of time before turning back on .,-1
"called acer support , they were completely useless .",-1
keeps disconnecting from my wifi at work .,-1
it was nice when it was working .,1
"i ' ve called twice to try to connect it to printer , first call they told me i had to get a cloud ready printer after getting said printer it still doesn ' t connect .",-1
very disappointed in this machine .,-1
i typically love acers ( i have a regular laptop ) but this machine has been a nightmare .,-1
issue summary : frequent crashing,-1
"6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk",0
"6 - inch hd touch , intel celeron n3150 , 4gb ddr3l , 32gb , chrome , cb5 - 132t - c1lk",0
it frequently crashes by displaying a bizarre screen displaying a large number of short horizontal lines and making a loud alarm noise .,-1
this issue happens more frequently when using netflix ( app or through chrome browser ) .,-1
"however it can happen at random , for example when signing into gmail .",-1
"it ' s okay for email , facebook , surfing the net , etc .",0
"so , this one isn ' t working out very well for my needs .",-1
i hope it is fixed this time .,-1
the other is excellent !,1
"has lots of issues , screen freezing , i was hoping to use it for banking etc .",-1
it feels like a tablet / computer for a child since it ' s so bulky and heavy .,-1
the mousepad was not very responsive .,-1
i really think it ' s junk .,-1
"this one is horrible , never can connect .",-1
"after years of using amazon for hundreds of orders , this is my very first negative review :",-1
i was very excited at the prospect of buying this laptop .,1
i was very impressed with its sleek design and the speed of the processor itself .,1
"a few hours of use later , i noticed that my battery was very low , around 10 % .",-1
"i even tried reinstalling the drivers and doing a system restore , nothing would fix it .",-1
i contacted asus and they could do nothing .,-1
i was so glad that the problem would finally be fixed .,1
"to my great dismay and disappointment , the power icon read the exact same message : ` ` plugged in , not charging ` ` .",-1
this was the second vivobook in a row !,-1
"am i just unlucky , or was this a bad batch ?",-1
i ' ve only found 2 other recent reviews of this product that had the same problem ( go ahead and search for them in the reviews ) .,-1
volume was not working .,-1
they would help me only if i bought an ongoing support contract with them .,-1
horrible way to run a company so i returned the item .,-1
"i purchased this laptop on the 11th of june 2018 and today is the 25th , which means i have had it for just about 2 weeks .",0
i noticed yesterday that the laptop was not charging anymore for reasons i can not deduce .,-1
i will attempt to return it as i am out of the us right now .,-1
it is quite disappointing .,-1
i am really concerned that this was not strongly made and just pretty .,-1
now a few weeks later monitor has died again .,-1
not worth it .,-1
i will return it .,-1
i thought it was a bad hdmi connection .,-1
"this laptop is beautiful , and that ' s about it .",1
it was fully charged and i only turned it on a total of 3 times before the screen went blank .,-1
at all and it took several minutes to boot up .,-1
turned it off and on and the screen still stays black but you can hear it running .,-1
cons - no light to indicate caps lock .,-1
"delete and power button too close to each other and looks the same , i accidentally pressed the power button couple of times .",-1
the built - in speaker is below average .,-1
"pros - slim , lightweight laptop due to 8th gen core - i5 .",1
"on day one , i had been using it for maybe 2 hours and it randomly shut off .",-1
"then the next day , same thing , screen goes black and it dies .",-1
im returning it .,-1
i will constantly be thinking about how it will probably fall apart in a few moths .,-1
"aside from that , laptop seems fine .",1
feel like at max brightness it just isn ' t enough .,-1
no backlit keyboard is kinda a bummer but i digress .,-1
the issue is that i got a faulty laptop and that ' s why the negative review .,-1
"i went with the asus vivobook based on the good specs , better hdd and ram , reviews , and because i could pay for it over several months .",1
their only solution was for me to go through the whole rma process and mail the laptop back for repair which would take weeks .,-1
"i ' m amazed how bad this machine is for the money , and for being described as a ` ` mid - level gamer . ` `",-1
it stutters on a 10 year old game .,-1
thanks amazon for your great return policy !,1
super thin - love the color - had to completely remove the operating system though - too many viruses already on the computer when received - had to get my own operating system and re - install everything,-1
6 inch laptop it appears fragile the keyboard itself feels like the keys will pop out .,-1
sad that i can ' t return this one .,-1
plus the screen is bland .,-1
with this asus i ' m experiencing 2 very disappointing issues .,-1
graphic issues : after opening any page or window with a black or dark color and i go back to a more bright or white page it takes at least 5 good second to gain the full luminosity,-1
"suddenly the keyboard goes crazy , starting on his own typing non stop ` ` mmmmmmmmm ` ` .",-1
this is very disappointing an causing me big issues while i write .,-1
the keys are easy to type on and the laptop itself is thin yet feels solid and well constructed .,1
this is a well constructed and powerful laptop that is perfect for everyday use as well as some otherwise intensive task such as large spreadsheets or presentations .,1
i double checked the outside labels and upon opening the box saw that the laptop had several deep scratches on the bottom of it .,0
i contacted amazon and have been issued a refund and ordered a replacement .,0
the m key popped off during initial setup .,-1
amazon is 2 - day shipping me a replacement .,0
i noticed today the laptop was not charging anymore .,-1
it is very very disappointing .,-1
edit : reinstalled the driver now the audio is better on earphones .,1
camera is sd but not a problem .,0
fingerprint scanner works well .,1
back lit keyboard should be a standard by now !,0
battery is all day amazing,1
with ssd lightning fast start up,1
no back light keyboard,-1
performance is mediocre,-1
consideration : if you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity .,1
"my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .",-1
this adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength .,1
best for : if you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light work this is an amazing buy for the price .,1
not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .,1
for the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as asus .,1
oh and this is a beautiful machine and the lid is amazing .,1
"i like the laptop for it ' s hardware , and it ' s working properly .",1
the actual laptop is very much darker and blue .,0
i ' m not at all happy about that .,-1
the new computer failed again with the same error .,-1
i am sure amazon will exchange it again but it is not worth the time and hassle .,-1
the speakers are also not great and the max volume on watching netflix or other videos is rather quite .,-1
the computer constantly pauses or stutters and then continues when it comes to loading web pages and working on documents .,-1
"overall , i ' m not very pleased with this computer .",-1
not happy with this one .,-1
the laptop does n ' t work .,-1
i ' ve tried every single option and still ca n ' t use it .,-1
unable to contact asus support for help .,-1
will never buy an asus product again .,-1
should ' ve stick with my pixelbook which was awesome and never have me trouble .,1
"return window is just a month , nothing can be done and now i am on mercy of asus .",-1
no backlighting on the keyboard .,-1
( i had to check that the caps lock was off after typing that last word . ),-1
"for the backlighting , he sent me some zip files for atk and chipset which i don ' t know how to use and which i shouldn ' t have to use .",-1
the fan blows like crazy and it makes so much noise .,-1
i don ' t even think i will be able to work on this it is so distracting .,-1
"this laptop was delivered with the screen broken , it was the christmas gift and when we removed the gift paper se found a laptop thant not worked , that ' s unfair and that should not be done yo any people on christmas night",-1
battery life is only 3 .,-1
high speed laptop,1
mousepad doesn ' t work .,-1
i have used this laptop only for work and the battery lasts and hour at most on mid performance .,-1
will not be buying asus again,-1
two cons i ' m disappointed about is the battery life and the flimsy keyboard .,-1
has a genaric feel to it .,0
they seemed to do nothing : fixing it was apparently my job .,-1
so now i ' m stuck with this dog but i ' m going to do all i can to get out the word that asus support is not the customer ' s friend : it ' s the customer ' s cross to bear .,-1
i ' ve had to reset the computer multiple times .,-1
i returned it because the speaker is dead low .,-1
power button is right next to the delete key .,-1
"all around , a very lacking laptop .",-1
* * returning the device - - that unhappy with the item .,-1
dead pixel on display on arrival,-1
the laptop charger has sparked repeatedly .,-1
i will be returning this item .,-1
do not buy it will not search what you type in i want my money back,-1
how can a brand new computer not charge properly ?,-1
screen backlight stopped working after just one month of light use .,-1
i received this laptop promptly .,1
"great battery life , a matte screen ( non - glossy ) full hd .",1
it will however win with substance .,1
its about what is inside of this amazing product .,1
"the screen quality is excellent , and i am fussy due to my interest in digital imagery .",1
"i can tell you for web surfing , the battery life is on par with what is advertised .",0
i could n ' t have put my feelings about my new acer aspire e 15 e5 - 576g - 5762 better .,1
"the 8th generation processor and ssd make for a very snappy computer , and the easy upgradablility is helpful now and will be useful in the future .",1
"i / o : tons of ports , a dvd burner , solid keyboard with good feel to the key strokes , and a very precise and responsive trackpad .",1
"plus the screen is matte , so bright lights are n ' t glaring .",1
overall impression : this is a killer laptop for a killer deal !,1
"i ' ve also discovered that the battery is better than i first thought , and will last 8 hours for light - duty activities such as web - surfing and word processing ; longer with power management on .",1
"my overall impression has not changed in the past 8 months , and i am still very impressed by it .",1
"thanks to its ssd , it boots windows 10 pretty fast , bloatware is kept to a minimum ( please uninstall norton before doing anything else .",1
": p ) , and the machine is definitely zippy .",1
"oh , and the nvidia card is plenty capable for gaming at medium settings at least ( grid autosport fps avg is in the 80s / 90s or so )",1
+ great and fast cpu and overall fast pc performance,1
+ decent full hd screen ( might be the ' crappiest ' thing on it and it is still good for the price ),1
- trackpad is too finicky and not my favorite,-1
need to play with it a bit more .,0
"as of now , for $ 600 or less , this is a nice buy .",1
this laptop is the best for the price in my opinion .,1
"there are 2 pretty significant flaws in the design however , one i think might only be on my laptop .",-1
- ips full hd screen .,0
- pretty loud speakers .,1
best pc bang for this level of buck .,1
"i will update this post if anything changes from what i posted , after i get the correct memory installed .",0
i have been beyond pleased with this laptop purchase over the last 6 months of use .,1
"i highly recommend this laptop for anyone looking for a great performing machine with an outstanding price ( just to be clear , it won ' t be running the newest high - end games on ultra - high graphics settings , but it still performs phenomenally for its price range and usage category ) .",1
"this laptop has been my traveling partner as i ' ve been traveling for 4 months , and i ' ve been extremely happy with the battery life , performance , and form of this machine .",1
"it is also amazingly quiet : the ssd doesn ' t make any noise , and the fan only spins up if i am doing something intensive like playing games or running a heafty program - just browsing or watching videos / basic office work will not make this computer more than whisper .",1
"so again , the battery is surprisingly great .",1
"the keyboard was a bonus for me : i really like having the number pad for when working with spreadsheets and such , and this size laptop doesn ' t always have one .",1
"additionally , this has a nice backlight to the keyboard , which will turn off when nothing has been pressed for about 20 seconds ( great for when just watching or reading something ) or can be manually turned off entirely .",1
"in addition , you are gifted with an sd card reader and an optical drive which can read and write cds and dvds ( which i can ' t say i ' ve used other than testing that it worked , but i do remember how hazardous it is to suddenly need something like that and not have it available ) .",1
"- though the case is plastic , the keyboard area itself has a cold metallic feel .",1
- the battery life is at least 8 hours .,1
"- the keys , often described as mushy , still have a decent click and distance to them .",1
- the backlit keyboard looks nice .,1
- i swear my screen periodically changes brightness but i can ' t tell if this is my imagination or not .,-1
- the webcam sucks but i don ' t care about that .,-1
"- easily upgradeable hdd ( it comes with a 512 ssd , which is fine for now , but is easily changed out )",1
- windows 10 ( do i really need to list the drawbacks of 10 ?,-1
"the e15 has a bright , 1080p screen - text is extremely sharp .",1
i also really like the finish on the case .,1
"i wish the power cord were longer , but that ' s minor .",0
"all in all , i ' m really glad i got this machine .",1
it has served me very well ever since .,1
so kudos to acer for the keyboard !,1
this laptop has an amazing price for the hardware it offers .,1
multiple ports for anything you need .,1
decent sized track pad .,1
screen is ips .,0
i figured out the day i got this laptop why the company was able to keep the price of this laptop even with the great hardware inside .,1
it cost 8 dollars and shipping is not cheap .,-1
taking off the entire back of the laptop is very difficult .,-1
overall the laptop is great for its price .,1
i should also mention that i got this laptop when it was 100 dollars off .,1
great laptop for expansion and upgrade .,1
all in all it is a great machine .,1
best laptop i ' ve ever owned .,1
this computer lives up to its expectations .,1
"the sound quality is ok , and even at full volume isn ' t that loud , but that ' s not a big deal for me .",0
"from the moment i opened it , i was thoroughly pleased .",1
it ' s lightning fast and handles games like skyrim and the witcher 3 surprisingly smoothly for the price i paid .,1
superb value for money and powerful performance from this quad core computer .,1
it has and does everything it should .,1
"screen is bright , doesn ' t feel heavy .",1
"i ' m not a power user , so it is perfect for my needs .",1
keys type nicely .,1
"only wish the power button was somewhere else , its too easy to hit accidentally .",-1
this laptop has handled everything i have thrown at it .,1
the screen looks good despite some other reviews .,1
my cpu also runs over 3ghz most of the time with no heating issues either .,1
after running good for the initial 25 first days it won ' t power on .,-1
i still find the one piece touch pads unreliable to use even after all the tweaking .,-1
"my first time with a solid state drive , very nice quick and quiet .",1
i will painfully learn the new pads .,-1
this is a light - use business laptop that we ' ve had for a month .,1
"the screen is more than sufficient for non - gaming , business use , and it seems as fast as expected .",1
"i ' ve owned several acer monitors that i ' ve always been pleased with , but this is the first computer .",1
"anyways , i am a bit sad that the ssd is a bit hidden and with very low memory , especially since i launched it and had to deal with half of it being full of bloatware ( btw , anyone who is looking for playing games on it , remember that the ssd will be faster and better at handling them , not the hard drive , all your programs and games should be installed to the ssd , all your files to the hard drive for those who don ' t know ) of course , with a little luck , that is fixable .",1
the screen looks great ( though maybe not if all you do is look at 4k resolution ) and the keyboard response feels pretty good .,1
"the battery life is not quite as long as advertised , but i can get through daily life just fine without lugging my charger everywhere .",0
to get the features like this good luck .,1
"its so fast just click and 1 to 2 seconds it shuffles through youtube , videos , web pages , any thing .",1
people said it wasn ' t bright enough but i run at 50 to 75 percent and its white bright .,1
"for the price , it ' s a solid laptop .",1
the keyboard is easy to type on ( and the backlight is an added plus ) .,1
you ' re not gon na find a deal like this too often .,1
"it ' s not perfect , but for casual users it ' s a steal .",1
i love this laptop !,1
"i have the intel core i7 , soooo fast !",1
comfortable keyboard !,1
love the cortana !,1
first time user for windows 10 and it ' s pretty good .,1
was very easy to add memory .,1
the acer is similar but bigger and heavier .,-1
hope this review can save others from the initial hassle i endured because the chromebook 3 looks terrific in any other way .,1
i bought the 4gb model which will hopefully last me a few years but it ' s nice and snappy now .,1
the 16gb of ssd storage is perfect as i use it for school and the biggest file i might be storing would be a picture .,1
it integrates perfectly with my google account !,1
"it ' s lightweight , has a long battery life and although it ' s smaller than a standard laptop , the keyboard is easy to use .",1
the only thing i ' m bummed about is the lack of google play .,-1
i ' ve gotten more use out of this thing than i first envisioned .,1
i added an sd card which has expanded on the 16gb of storage .,0
i have been using a chromebook now for three years and am totally satisfied .,1
for the price you can ' t beat a chromebook .,1
chromebooks are light weight and start up immediately and are very easy to use .,1
my old chromebook is an acer and i ' ve had absolutely no problems with it .,1

"i highly recommend the samsung chromebook for browsing the internet , and for note taking .",1
it ' s lightweight and fits easily in a tote or backpack .,1
it holds up well .,1
i use it sort of all day and night and i haven ' t found anything it won ' t do .,1
occasionally it will get sort of slow and then i ' ll go to settings and clear the image cache and that takes care of it .,0
the keyboard is nice .,1
i type 100 wpm and i like the keyboard and touch pad a lot .,1
the keys are responsive and quiet .,1
the power cord is super compact and is just the plug and cord with no big clunky thing on it .,1
google updates are super fast .,1
it ' s absolutely silent .,1
no fans grinding away .,1
i sit with it in my lap all day long and it never gets hot .,1
i don ' t play video games but i imagine that it would play cloud - based games fine .,1
the only program i couldn ' t find a cloud solution for was scrivener .,0
it holds up to constant use and it ' s really sturdy despite being really slim and lightweight .,1
"i have used this computer daily now for about 6 months , spending hours per day on it for an emt / paramedic class .",0
it ' s extremely fast and has very little lag when opening pages or surfing the web .,1
"( * cough ' quizlet ' cough * ) i use this hooked up to my mobile hotspot from my cell phone mainly , and it allows me access anywhere i have cell service .",1
", as it doesn ' t have large built in memory .",-1
"first time chrome os user , very streamlined and easy to use .",1
"amazing battery life , i could go on .",1
i can carry both of them in a reasonably sized purse and not hurt my shoulder .,1

"the plastic seems sturdy , the keys don ' t stick * , the mousepad feels pleasant .",1
"it doesn ' t get super loud , but for normal usage situations it ' s fine .",0
- it does slow down noticeably if you ' re doing too much at once .,-1
"if i have a video call going on facebook messenger , chrome will take three or four seconds to respond .",-1
"if you ' re going to be doing a lot of heavy lifting , this might not be the chromebook for you .",-1
"overall , the problems are fairly minor and for the price i ' m happy with what i got .",1
"i ' m travelling overseas with it , and it goes everywhere i do and does everything i do - except i can no longer multitask and annoy my mother in video calls !",1
the 4gb / 32gb version is fast and smooth and has enough storage space for your work documents and e - books for ready access when no internet is available .,1
5 pound laptop with its nine hour battery life .,1
i * love * it !,1
"i have been using samsung chromebooks for 5 years , my 2012 chromebook was finally hard to charge , but it might have had something to do with having been dropped several times , and still running great , but hard to charge .",1
"* love * the feel and look of it , no complaints at all , samsung chromebooks are amazing !",1
"makes a huge difference in the customer service you ' ll get , and amazon ' s is outstanding !",1
"this is completely different , feels solid , looks great , operates like a great samsung chromebook should , and for $ 169 , you just can ' t go wrong .",1
"chromebooks do not have a cd / dvd drive or some other features of higher end laptops , but i love them ! )",1

they are lightweight and easy to carry .,1

the home screen is blank with a customizable photo that you can add but that ' s it .,0
love it !,1
it arrived as promised and was exactly as described .,1
they loved them and said they worked perfectly .,1
one of my favorite things i own,1
if you do n ' t need a full blown laptop this is a good choice .,1
the speakers on at the front on bottom so sound quality isn ' t the best .,0
"battery life is great for reviewing adobe forms and web surfing , pretty good for youtube videos .",1
my only issue is the wifi likes to randomly turn off then back on .,-1
i was very surprised at how fast it came .,1

beautiful resolution,1
bigger screen,1
nice keyboard,1
"the charge cord is very short , about 1 / 2 the size of a regular charging cord",-1

this is the most well priced laptop for its spec,1

lenovo computers are of chinese manufacture and thus you will not know if yours is one of the pla ' s cyber - spies .,0
battery life short,-1
i ' ve had this laptop for 4 months and it ' s run very well considering it ' s price .,1
"only issue is that the graphics aren ' t quite as good as i expected , but i didn ' t buy this to use as a gaming pc so i ' m not overly concerned about it .",0
"this is a great laptop for web browsing , skype , and more simple games .",1

"excellent computer , better than expected .",1
great service with amazon on fulfilling my order .,1
i am truly enjoying my laptop after one month .,1
i use it for streaming with the elgato device and it doesn ' t miss a beat .,1
you can ' t beat the price for what you are getting with this computer .,1
love the graphics when i replay my videos or watch other streamers .,1
"if you need a decent computer that runs quality this is it , especially if you are starting out .",1
the fans did not turn on loudly if at all .,1
purchased as a mothers day gift but i ' ve come to respect the quality and performance of lenovo .,1
"i bought this because i have a desk job overnight that usually has a lot of down time so i when i have the ability to i can open this up and catch up on my news , watch movies , and even play video games and the graphics card in it is amazing .",1
"fast delivery , thanks to amazon .",1
"excellent price , i bought it for a beginner in art design field .",1
it ' s been about 3 weeks since my purchase of my lenova laptop and figure it ' s time to give my all important review .,0
love the price reduction and the lenova one year warranty .,1
"pros : nice size , clear screen , quick on start up , very functional and easy to use .",1
"it ' s also very lightweight , so it ' s easy to carry around .",1
i love the fact that it can extend and be flat .,1
the keyboard is a nice size and the pads clicks on touch and not stiff or hard .,1
it also has a lot of space and memory .,1
cons : i wished it had a backlight on the keyboard .,-1
the battery life sucks as it starts to die after 3 - 4 hours of use ( no gaming ) .,-1
"lastly , the touch pad , even after lowering the sensitivity , it ' s still pretty sensitive and the click pads are stiff , so it doesn ' t tap on clicks , sometimes i have to click on it hard enough , so that ' s a bit annoying .",-1
"after reading a lot of the reviews on here , i was unsure about laptop .",0
"only con would be that display is not that bright , although i would say at the brightest setting is probably where it should be .",-1
also audio is pretty decent .,1
"lenovo should put a better battery in it , and should make a retrofit available .",-1
but if you keep it plugged in it ' s great !,1
"lenovo paid for my shipping to the repair facility since i ' d had it such a short time , and they fixed and returned it in a reasonable time period .",1
"have not tried customer service so no comment , but this is a nice sub $ 400 machine .",1
i love this laptop !,1
it works like it is made to run linux .,1
the only real complain is the same one everyone else has with this model and that is the battery life could be better .,-1
it does great and has lots of cool stuff,1
excellent product and experience with the purchase .,1
but the worse webcam i ' ve seen in a while and the battery dies very fast .,-1
it was easy to set up .,1
it is a very good laptop .,1
it has everything he wanted and needs .,1
we have always liked lenovo laptops .,1
love it so far very nice product and it do what it is set out to do,1
i got this lenovo ideapad 320 ( the amd a12 7th generation version ) and it ' s absolutely incredible !,1
really fast also lenovo ' s customer service excellent .,1
cons hd display is n ' t the greatest,-1
battery last 2 1 / 2 hours,0
i don ' t like the fact that the battery go low very fast .,-1
"it has way more than i will ever need because all i do is check my email and facebook , but it is crazy fast .",1
i don ' t really have anywhere to rest my hand when i use it because it ' s so large .,-1
otherwise i really do love it,1
plenty of memory and storage .,1
love this laptop,1
i am very happy with this laptop .,1
the screen is just right .,1
i bought this for my daughter for school and she loves it .,1
the specs are good on this for a good cheap low end gaming machine .,1
so before you get angry do your homework on why the laptop may be acting strange .,-1
great computer .,1
"fast , sturdy with a beautiful display",1
"1 , bloatware from hell and 2 , a very cheap crappy 5400rpm hdd .",-1
multitasking is pretty good .,1
battery is okay .,0
keyboard is pretty damn good and the track pad is fair .,1
"fan noise could be a bit quieter when the cpu is being taxed but not annoyingly loud either , under lite use the pc is silent .",0
"has ac wireless so you can see the 5ghz on your network , blazing fast .",1
at this price range it is a fine screen .,1
great laptop if you are willing to put in an ssd and reinstall windows .,1
it is very easy to use the set up was awesome .,1
that said if you ' re not a computer savvy no worries as soon as you turn it on cortana the computers assistant walks you through everything that you need to do .,1
i have had no issues with it since i bought it i would highly recommend it .,1
i loved how fast it was .,1
"also can not just ` ` add ` ` memory ddms : only one socket means you must remove the 8gb and purchace a 16gb ( ~ $ 180 further investment ) ; battery not gon na last several hrs , looking at ~ 2 - 4 .",-1
i love this laptop so far .,1
the start up process was very simple and relatively quick .,1
i was able to download all of my games in a quick amount of time too .,1
"the laptop is the perfect size , it ' s not too heavy and it ' s slim .",1
have had mine for about 3 - 4 wks and have had no trouble .,1
"the tech and the quantities ( ram , etc . )",1
it ' s still loading and working pretty fast and you ca n ' t beat the storage for the price .,1
overall i ' m happy with it for what i use it for .,1
if your main priority is a long lasting battery this is n ' t for you .,-1
great price for a nice laptop .,1
bought this for my daughter ' s senior year of college and she ' s very happy .,1
it is a very nice computer that serves his needs very well .,1
"8g is enough to do most daily activities , i use nvidia geforce now to play much higher end games like destiny 2 , r6 and what not .",0
the only cons are the battery and the brightness of the screen .,-1
this is a brand i look for that i feel i can trust .,1
works great and looks great .,1
great buy .,1
"the laptop works well , i have no complaints .",1
the only draw back with this pc is the battery life which lasts about 3 hrs before needing to be charged .,-1
nice little computer for the price .,1
"but i would have never bought it if i knew that windows 10 was the worst , god awful garbage operating system i have ever encountered .",-1
i hate windows 10 .,-1
liking it a lot .,1
haven ' t had it long so only 4 stars but if it holds up it ' s worth 5 .,1
has nice features for the price and nice video for streaming movies .,1
bought this for my ten year old for school and creating .,0
she loves it !,1
i would buy this for myself as well .,1
"i do like it , just now that i had time to use it in preparing for my exams , the following was observed : -",1
battery life sucks .,-1
the camera sucks .,-1
this is nice for the price and has good speed .,1
this laptop exceeds my expectations for a mid - price laptop .,1
the only problem is that certain streaming video applications freeze up in windows 10 and i can not remember how i resolved the problem on my old laptop .,-1
"the customer support rep at amazon was of no help , though he did try .",0
i use this laptop for work .,0
"otherwise , it ' s a good computer .",1
it ' s pretty fast even with heavy use and multiple applications running at once .,1
"love the laptop ; great quality ; sent as expected , on time .",1
it is far and away the best i ' ve ever had .,1
fantastic computer .,1
the programs run great with no lag time .,1
battery lasts for quite sometime .,1
it ' s not real fast and it doesn ' t have a lot of storage .,-1
i don ' t ask much of a laptop so i am happy with it .,1
"it ' s fast , connects quickly to wifi , and the screen is quite nice .",1
i liked the fact that lenovo came with the microsoft programs on it .,1
"the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .",-1
no problems with this computer .,1
i enjoy that it has 10 key .,1
fast to start up .,1
for reference : ive had this laptop for about 4 months now for my first year at college .,0
"if all you are looking for is a reliable laptop to write papers on or to browse the web , this is good .",1
youtube works well on here .,1
battery life is horrible though .,-1
easy to use and set up .,1
sorry not a fan of windows 10 .,-1
nice little laptop .,1
"nice laptop for every day use , with some extra features .",1
"my only issue is that the fan is very noisy and gets stuck at times , causing worry about the laptop getting overheated .",-1
"i am very much in the causal gamer category , sims 4 being probably the most taxing ( on the system ) game i will play , and it seems to be running it just fine .",1
really happy with this laptop !,1
i just received this product about an hour or so ago .,0
i have yet to update the drives on it or try a game but so far its a good machine .,1
i recommend buying it .,1
very good purchase .,1
the price was great during prime days .,1
works well so far .,1
"price and product , outstanding .",1
still learning but it ' s a good computer and a great deal,1
"it look like a professional laptop but overrall get this laptop you wo n ' t regret it , no negativity about it",1
great computer for the price,1
works well .,1
"great laptop , very quick and efficient for work and casual gaming , got over 200 fps for steam games .",1
great speed and storage .,1
i ' ve had it since may and enjoy it,1
"1 , the touchscreen stopped working after 6 months for finger presses .",-1
samsung keeps telling me that the serial number is invalid .,0
samsung ' s warranty process was not working properly for this device .,-1
when i called they would not accept the serial number .,-1
don ' t buy it .,-1
"do not buy it like me , a samsung fan .",-1
this device ( and its brother the plus ) has a grave hardware flaw that causes the touchscreen to move on its own .,-1
i got a replacement unit and it had the same issue .,-1
samsung has not been helpful in getting this fixed .,-1
it makes the entire device unusable .,-1
"ridiculous for something so expensive , some internet research shows numerous people having this issue .",-1
samsung rma ' d the device to replace the screen .,0
the solution i am trying for now is to disable the touch screen .,0
hot / dead pixels on screen after 4 months use .,-1
the pro worked great until now .,1
"now there are pixels on the screen not working , and they are multiplying .",-1
the pixels are currently stuck .,-1
"i will see if samsung honors their warrnty , if so , i will probably change / update this review .",0
"oops , i didn ' t anticipate android is crippled on here .",-1
i am terribly disappointed with obviously a poor qc by samsung .,-1
"unfortunately , on day 2 since i received the chromebook pro , when i flipped the lid to turn it into a tablet / tent mode , screen started flickering all over the place .",-1
"returning it into a standard laptop position did not help , the screen actually turned dark and only closing and opening the lid helped return it to normal state .",-1
"to make things worse , i currently live overseas and am highly doubtful that samsung would do anything about this , given that it was bought in the us .",-1
"no matter where on earth , you can get your apple product repaired .",1
"in short , i would be very cautious as to ordering this product given the obvious history of quality control issues .",-1
"wanting something maybe a pinch faster , but more importantly , a flippy touchscreen with google play support .",1
"first and foremost , lets talk about the infamous keyboard .",-1
"yes , it ' s absolute garbage .",-1
"i ' m surprised people are settling for claiming ` ` it ' s good enough ` ` or ` ` gets the job done ` ` when every time i use it , i ' m constantly reminded of how i should have just sprang for the pixelbook when it was on sale for $ 699 .",-1
i ' ve owned / used dozens upon dozens of keyboards and there is absolutely no questions this one is the worst .,-1
my 2nd issues is with it ' s performance .,-1
even in the early rounds the frames are heavily compromised and the entire game feels very sluggish .,-1
"i ' ll give the chromebook pro an extra star for its best asset , the screen .",1
it does indeed look excellent !,1
"it ' s also worth noting my unit came with a floating trackpad , with initial play before the actually click .",-1
"if you are indifferent about the screen , do not buy this !",1
i just got this chromebook last week and since then i ' ve had to do a hard reboot once and it has reset itself to factory settings about 5 times .,-1
there is a power button on the side which i have accidentally hit quite a few times .,-1
"i haven ' t abused this at all , and i noticed a small crack in the screen today and it ' s starting to spider out .",-1
so $ 500 bucks down the drain as i ' m sure that isn ' t covered by any warranties .,-1
with it being a touch screen it surprised me that it cracked and i have no idea how .,-1
my screen stayed black more than it was on .,-1
samsung needs to fix that issue .,-1
"possible note , it was very light .",1
"while this thing is gorgeous and the perfect size for what i was looking for , my initial display died after not even 12 hours of use .",1
"except , you know , when it decided to become unusable .",-1
i just wanted to make it known my personal experiences with the device .,0
awesome display .,1
fast boot and reliable os .,1
chassis could be studier and keyboard and trackpad very average and lack of backlight is a deal breaker for me .,-1
mouse track pad is non standard .,-1
it ' s hard to navigate and i had to buy a usb mouse and a usb connector .,-1
i say this device is worth no more than $ 300 .,-1
"it is very limited and the competition for an actual usable operating system that can do a lot more than just browse the internet , are available .",-1
the quality is is meh .,-1
"its cheap plastic and honestly , the keyboard its really bad .",-1
it simply feels like a cheap samsung tablet with a keyboard attached .,-1
the playstore its immature .,-1
"their designs are made for phones and on this huge screen , they are palpitated .",-1
"this is quite honest , a very expensive chrome browser .",-1
i do not recommend it at this price point .,-1
i would however spend $ 300 on this device .,0
its current price is not worth it .,-1
after a couple of weeks i started experiencing web browsing issues .,-1
first occasionally and later to a point where the laptop became unusable .,-1
after some googling i realized that the wifi issue was related to bluetooth being on .,-1
stylus also failed and is now stuck inside the laptop so i can ' t really use it for screen capturing .,-1
10 minutes after finishing this review started having a new issue : touch pad started acting out .,-1
"you know , i wanted to love this machine .",0
i went in to this purchase assuming that the availability of android apps from the google play store would make this unit into a true windows alternative .,-1
"before i get to that , let me first confirm that the keyboard is indeed appallingly bad .",-1
"' what a bunch of whiners , ' i concluded about all the people who slammed the keyboard .",-1
so one star off for the keyboard .,-1
"needless to say , if you thought this capability would allow you to use a browser other than chrome , forget it .",-1
none of their android versions were what i would call usable .,-1
"in short , this unit is a chromebook with a really nice display .",1
"if you want to spend 5 or 6 hundred bucks for that , rock on .",-1
"unfortunately , my chromebook that i purchased through best buy was dead on arrival .",-1
the problem is that it never charged .,-1
the cable functions just fine .,0
the chromebook is simply dead from what i can tell .,-1
"as you can see , the cable is active , but the ` ` power led ` ` has never had any color .",-1
"very disappointing , samsung !",-1
i really needed this product for work and had big plans for using it ' s features / versatility .,0
all i got was a fancy 2lb metal slab that can only be used to swat flies .,-1
apparently there is some optimizations that google has done with the op1 and pixel that allow what is called instant ink .,1
i have also noticed the pro seems to run hotter and have a noticeably shorter battery life .,-1
initially the product lived up to the expectations .,0
"there were challenges with the chromebook specific apps and the google play store apps worked sometimes , but most of them had the size issue where they are only the size of a phone screen .",-1
reliability is completely terrible - i use it for work but definitely wouldn ' t buy for personal use as it ' s had to be repaired and replaced twice already - once for just momentarily stopping and then for the touch screen not working with hand input ( worked for the pen which btw is kind of useless except in a few android apps as the handwriting recognition is limited to a lame popup panel - there ' s no integration ) .,-1
also the case design is sort of rounded at both sides - a minor issue but it makes the device pop open in my purse and detracts from the ` ` feel ` ` of the device by making it feel a lot thicker than it actually is .,-1
"horrible , purchased directly from google , dead pixel on arrival , note feature did not pick up stylus and bluetooth rarely worked .",-1
"sent it in , arrived back in an inadequate box ( i shipped it in the oroginal with protective foam came back in the box from samsung w / o any protection ) and 3 days after i recieved the item back the stylus fell apart .",-1
"customer service told me that i ' d have to buy a new one , item is still under warranty .",-1
"i picked up the stylus and it fell apart , no drops no damage .",-1
samsung makes garbage and treats their customers with no respect .,-1
never again will i buy samsung products and thats what i ' d suggest here .,-1
no caps lock on the keyboard .,-1
virtually every single app for it is compromised in some manner .,-1
apps have to close and be reopened to get them to a somewhat decent size .,-1
chrome os is not matured in any way .,-1
"it calls itself a computer , but it ' s really not .",-1
"it fancies itself a convertible notebook / app consuming functional tablet , but it is not .",-1
"for example , many of the apps currently available on the play store which work perfectly well on your android phone or tablet do not work in chromeos .",-1
"google is very concerned about arc to chromeos connections for security , etc etc .",0
the rub is that chromeos itself is so limited in functionality that it is probably the most secure os platform out there .,-1
apps are glitchy .,-1
certain apps ( especially flash based apps ) will get the machine very hot .,-1
the bottom plastic piece - this is not a unibody machine - will be too hot to rest on bare skin .,-1
"i can not explain why , except to think that there is something wrong with the voltage wiring and the left channel is exceeding design capacity .",-1
the left charging port does not always make full contact with the charger and so sometimes the usb c charger is plugged in and slightly awry and therefore not charging .,-1
the touchpad doesn ' t have clickable function in the top right or top left corners which is becomes annoying for certain tasks .,-1
"many of acer ' s chromebooks have , historically , been hampered by their poor displays .",-1
the chromebook 14 has a 1080p ips display with fantastic viewing angles and excellent brightness .,1
i keep it at about 60 - 70 % and it looks fantastic .,1
it feels wonderful to finally say that about an acer display .,1
"a more recent trend among chrome os devices is the inclusion of 4gb of ram and 32gb of storage , instead of the 2gb / 16gb to which we ' ve become accustomed .",0
"the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .",1
"the screen is great , for both media consumption and general computing / web browsing ; it offers a nice amount of local storage and solid performance via the intel processor and 4gb of ram , and it looks sharp , thanks to modern design queues and aluminum build materials .",1
"it also has much better performance , including an easily upgraded m .",1
"the acer is very nice , to be sure , especially considering the price or $ 299 .",1
it also has pretty decent i / o with two usb 3 .,1
i can ' t help but feel that people are also slightly exaggerating the performance offered by the n3160 .,-1
"it is solid , and does a decent job rendering pages , and paired with the extra ram here , it adequately handles streaming content in the background - such as youtube or spotify - and still maintains a decent browsing experience across eight to ten additional tabs ;",1
"none of this means the acer chromebook 14 is a bad chromebook ; on the contrary , it is an excellent chromebook !",1
"i led with those first five points for a reason : being able to purchase a decently - performing chromebook with aluminum build , a 1080p ips display , 4gb of ram , 32gb of local storage , and an intel quad - core processor for $ 299 is basically what the entirely of the chromeos subreddit has been asking for over the past few years .",1
"5 years old or matched by chromebooks at half the price , the absence of a touchscreen upgrade , or the use of slower emmc storage instead of a real m .",-1
these are all valid points that probably make this more of a 4 .,1
"acer has identified the chromebook market gaps and solved almost everything in this extremely solid offering - a thin , metal , almost mac - like build , armed with 4gb of ram , a full 14 ` ` hd display and a quad - core cpu .",1
even the touchpad and keyboard perform as well as the very best chromebooks currently available .,1
"anything that runs in a chrome browser on a desktop or laptop will run on a chromebook , and there are novel app - like extensions for almost anything else ( calculator apps , command lines , etc . )",1
"for an office , you can give everyone a chromebook and their environment becomes available on login and disappears when they sign - out , and the machines can also be remotely managed if you ' re a google apps customer .",1
"for students and road warriors , the extended battery life and automatic cloud integration makes sync - ing a breeze , especially if you hotspot from your phone .",1
"from the camera and audio quality through to the build styling , every aspect of this pc has been meticulously considered and it represents the best chromebook that has been delivered to date",1
the keyboard on this unit is actually quite nice .,1
"the hardware specs on this are very nice compared to other offerings : 4g ram , 32g storage , quad - core processor , etc .",1
"the screen is beautiful , and the speakers are very nice .",1
"the mouse area is responsive , and has a nice feel to it .",1
"the overall unit has a slim profile , and is light weight .",1
"thus far , i am very happy with the purchase , and highly recommend it .",1
i think biggest reason i like it is that it ' s sturdy and i don ' t mind throwing it in and out of my backpack whereas with a $ 1000 mb air i might be a whole lot more careful in how i handle it .,1
hope to continue to get many more years of use out of it !,1
"bought this for someone else , can ' t believe how good it is .",1
this thing is good .,1
this is one of the best purchases i have made in years .,1
"since i already do all of my work in google drive , this is perfect for me .",1
it ' s the best solution i ' ve used for collaborating on a budget .,1
"however , know what you ' re buying before you get a chromebook : it operates on a chrome operating system and you can ' t install apps or games on it like world of warcraft .",0
screen quality is perfect and matte so no annoying glare !,1
the keys on the keyboard are sunk in a little too low to accommodate for the sleek / thin profile .,-1
it take a bit of getting used to .,0
"first off the chromebook itself is excellent , one of the few budget models with 1080p and a long battery life .",1
it arrived in ` ` as new ` ` condition despite being a refurbished ( likely a return ) .,1
it is a steal at $ 179 and worth a 5 star rating for the previous reasons .,1
as other reviews have mentioned - its a bit heavier than expected for such a slim frame .,-1
"overall , i ' m definitely satisfied , i bought it wanting a well built laptop on the larger end ( which is why i ultimately went with the 14 inch ) with a solid material / frame .",1
build quality seems excellent .,1
i purchased mine in the gold color and its beautiful .,1
beautiful ips display .,1
i ' m running it at 2500x1400 resolution extremely thin and lightweight .,1
now it kind of feels a little bit like windows but still different .,0
it on the developer channel and have full access to the play store .,1
update : device now has full support for the play store on the beta channel .,1
this makes this chromebook closer to a real computer .,1
"the system is quick , and used for browsing , and basic notes .",1
"the keyboard gives a satisfying audible response to being used , and the mouse is nice .",1
"that machine couldn ' t handle all the tabs i wanted to keep open , so after much research , i jumped into this acer .",1
"it ' s great in many ways ; the build is solid , the screen is good ( and the resolution is insane ) , and the keyboard is decent , though only time will tell if it ' s as diet coke - resistant as the samsung ' s keys are .",1
one thing keeps it from getting a five - star rave from me .,-1
it is very light weight .,1
more importantly i appreciate the uncanny speed to boot up or wake up .,1
never has it run out of power while on battery .,1
"but they didn ' t make it $ 300 by wasting money , there are compromises .",1
the 1080p display is very sharp .,1
you can watch 1080p video on it and it looks great .,1
i find the picture more watchable than my tv .,1
the audio is great .,1
the keyboard is good .,1
but the 4 gb of ram makes the things you use a chromebook for work without delay .,1
where they didn ' t sacrifice is on build quality .,1
great device for browsing the internet .,1
hulu app is not supported for this computer so you will need to use the browser .,-1
the keyboard is difficult to get used to due to the placement and spacing of the keys compared to a regular keyboard .,-1
"the battery life has started to go down after a year of solid use ( still quite good ) , but the quality screen and chromeos make it worth it .",1
acer put together a solid package .,1
i still had some of those kinds of mishaps with the chromebook - - but not nearly as many .,-1
the machine is great for streaming videos - - my wife and i use it regularly to watch things on amazon prime - - and the battery last quite a while .,1
he wanted something that could browse the internet fast - and this chromebook does just that !,1
i love how slim the design is - will fit easily into my backpack : ) highly recommend for everyday or school use !,1
i ' ve kept an eye on chromebooks for the last couple of years as a possible option for a low - cost laptop .,1
"the chrome rdp app also works well , connecting to my windows machines with good performance , and i can access files on my nas using network file shares after using the chromebook for the last couple of weeks , i ' d confidently recommend one for everything but gaming and special purpose applications .",1
"the quality of this unit exceeds my expectations , and if feels solidly built while still very thin and light .",1
"the keyboard and track pad are both quite good , although i always use a real mouse .",1
"battery life is excellent , and i can get several days use before needing to plug in .",1
with a solid cpu and 4gb of memory i can run a dozen or more open tabs with good performance .,1
"saving the best for last , the full hd screen is one of the primary reasons i chose this chromebook , and it is wonderful .",1
"to me , this chromebook is a great value .",1
this acer chromebook 14 is by far the best chromebook 300 dollars can buy .,1
with chrome remote desktop i am able to play turn - based video games such as hearthstone or civ 5 while miles away from the computer actually running them .,1
it is also very gnu + linux friendly if you want to replace the os entirely .,1
overall this chromebook is perfect for my current use - case and would recommend it to anyone in the chromebook market with 300 dollars to spare .,1
it does not interface well with any printer i could find as nothing would download for a driver because it needs to be a mac or windows .,-1
you can ' t use it to edit a word document .,0
i could not be happier with this computer because i am not the best person with technology .,1
i don ' t know how to use a lot of computers but this is simple and easy to use .,1
very easy to set up and light to carry .,1
this is an amazing computer .,1
"however , having been out of school for several years now , the viability of purchasing a mac ( particularly as they are increasing in price ) no longer seems viable .",-1
"first of all , the battery life on it is insane .",1
"first , it is hard to run more than 10 tabs open at any given time .",-1
"first time users might have a hard time using the keyboard ( some keys like caps lock , pagedown , pageup , delete , home etc are missing , browse the internet to get the equivalent ones ) .",-1
the build quality is good ( all aluminum body ) .,1
the boot up is fast .,1
"camera is not that good , so video call on mobile phone is better .",0
"this chromebook is easy to use , boot up quickly but it does occasionally crash and a push of the on / off button will quickly reset it .",1
the chromebook is quite ideal for those who use their computer mostly for surfing the internet .,1
"we actually returned the first acer chromebook 14 , we got because the screen would blink randomly and go off .",-1
as for actual device it is completely gorgeous and ( now ) works flawlessly .,1
"he was ecstatic at the power , the screen , the layout - pretty much everything .",1
"while the device is awesome , and there are lots of other reviews that will tell you exactly how awesome , i am just so impressed by how amazon ' s customer service handled the issue .",1
guaranteed excellent customer service !,1
"keep in mind , you have to pay $ for ms office where google docs is free .",1
"overall , the way i see it , i ' m getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet .",1
this acer is a web surfer that ' s easy to travel with .,1
"first of all , this is a physically beautiful machine .",1
"the keyboard is a delight with large , nearly flush , keys set to just the right level of resistance and sensitivity .",1
"love the style , aluminum shell , 14 inches monitor , and decent resolution .",1
this little chromebook is very nice and is pretty much what i expected .,1
this is my first chromebook purchase and i have to say that i ' m enjoying the speed and simplicity of it .,1
"in summary , it looks great and performs very well .",1
battery life has been very good .,1
acer makes a good unit too .,1
i purchased this item 7 months ago and i love it .,1
i purchased this chromebook strictly for writing / editing ( i ' m an independent and published author ) and web browsing .,0
the aluminum casing adds to the durable feel of the unit and gives it a nice attractive look as well .,1
the only thing i did not like about the design is the fact that the speakers are on the bottom of the unit .,-1
losing the function keys for a toucher was a deal breaker .,-1
"the base model went up in price $ 400 , which excludes any performance benefits .",-1
"the only real upgrade for the new one , before adding on options is faster memory .",1
"i run windows and linux vms fairly regularly and while i could run them on a comparable windows system , adding windows systems to an already portly windows system has never worked out well for me , so while disappointed in the new upgrades , this 2015 model still rocks vms and does all i need it too for far less $ $ $ .",-1
"while usb - c is cool , a bag full of dongles is not .",1
"with real function keys , i don ' t worry about one vendor or another not upgrading fast enough and losing virtual function keys , so this model is golden .",1
"anyway , if you are contemplating buying one of these and they are still available , do it .",1
everything from the power cord to the computer looks brand new .,1
"in fact , the only way you know it ' s probably not new is because it didn ' t arrive in an apple original box ; it arrived wrapped ( neat and tight ) in bubble wrap in an amazon box .",1
"with the recent apple upgrade to macbook pros ( the touch of genius bar or whatever ) , the price has jumped .",0
i can ' t justify paying that kind of money for some ridiculous upgrade .,-1
happy i got a great machine for half the cost !,1
i ' m seeing a lot of reviews saying they received the wrong item .,0
the one i purchased wasn ' t the cheapest but for peace of mind i gladly paid it .,1
- new radeon graphics card ( finally ! ),1
- retina display is actually sharper .,1
"i thought that it wouldn ' t make any difference , but it does on games",1
- the computer is 1 pound ( approx .,1
that is awesome .,1
super fast boot .,1
"when the computer is working hard , it doesn ' t burn my lap anymore ( although i do feel some hot air flowing through my fingertips , when i am typing , but i am okay with that ) .",1
the plug keeps unplugging .,-1
"with magsafe 2 , even the gentlest pull makes the plug to disconnect , which is very annoying for me .",-1
- memory is not easily upgradable anymore .,-1
- ssd ( solid state drive ) is not easily upgradable .,-1
- no ethernet connection and firewire 800 port .,-1
- no audio in port .,-1
now audio in and out are combined in just one port .,-1
i don ' t like this .,-1
it ' s very expensive for such a simple device .,-1
- the screen is harder to clean .,-1
- keyboard keys have a shorter touch .,0
i ' m okay with that given that the body is thinner .,1
in the beginning i felt a little weird about this trackpad .,-1
"overall , i think it is a great purchase .",1
with how slim this thing is i really don ' t see a need for the macbook air line .,1
the display is fantastic on this laptop .,1
battery life : i haven ' t had the laptop for too long but easily get 8 hours or more on a charge .,1
the keyboard is ok .,0
"other than that , the key sizes are good and the backlighting works just fine .",1
the trackpad has gotten better with this new model .,1
the click is now provided by a haptic engine and provides more functionality .,1
the thing is fantastic .,1
this is easily the best trackpad i have ever used .,1
apps open instantly and the ac wifi performance is very nice .,1
you can even run time machine backups while the computer is sleeping now .,1
"i ' m not sure when this feature was introduced , but it is very welcome .",1
"i have not messed with the continuity feature much , but it is nice having the favorites and open tabs sync from my laptop to my iphone .",1
"the current model only has two , which can be problematic if you hook up an external hard drive and an external bluray drive ( which requires two ports ) at the same time .",-1
"sure , another generation back was arguably better , but i find this computer to be adequate to my needs right now ( though it is a disappointment that i can ' t upgrade the ram , which definitely limits the lifetime of how long this product will last ) .",0
"it ' s nice and lightweight , the sd port is useful , and it ' s powerful enough for me to do fairly layer intensive graphic design work in photoshop and basic grading in lightroom .",1
the keys feel fantastic to type on .,1
the overall design is sleek and pleasing to look at and hold .,1
the force touch trackpad works great .,1
"overall , i feel this is the best laptop i ' ve ever purchased or used .",1
"it feels sturdy and reliable , both hardware and software - wise .",1
i waited for a while before writing a review about this product .,0
"after a couple of months of using this product , i finally could say that it ' s the best thing that i have ever bought up to this moment .",1
i use this laptop every single day for at least 2 hours and believe me it ' s just great .,1
"therefore , my advice to you if you ' re a student and you need a laptop for school , this laptop is the best choice for you .",1
"and if you ' re concerned about the system , i would tell you that as a person who has never used a macbook before actually buying it , do not worry you will get used to it in no time as i did .",1
i ' m glad i got this .,1
"amazon warehouse marked this as ` ` like new ` ` but upon receiving , this unit was brand new .",1
i am very happy with this purchase especially for the price .,1
"at the time of this posting , this model was going only for 1800 for the 512gb with a dedicated video card .",1
"win for the ports , win for the price , and win for a brand new unopened macbook .",1
love love love this laptop !,1
the display is excellent !,1
you can actually take a picture of this screen and not have near the amount of wavy lines that you used to get .,1
"i really like the fact that when it boots up , it ' s up .",1
"this thing boots up , you log in and you ' re ready to go !",1
my review is based on the fact that i got a pretty good value on this when it was selling for $ 200 less than normal .,1
"i ' m probably a bit biased on macs since i ' m a professional graphic designer , and it ' s just the industry standard .",0
"if you ' re considering a switch from windows based pcs to apple computers , i ' d probably recommend that you look at what you ' re going to use it for .",0
fantastic computer !,1
i was due to upgrade and this product seemed perfect for me .,1
i have had three macbook pro ' s and all have been excellent .,1
the key board is one of the best i ' ve ever typed on .,1
this is my first ever macbook and i will never go back .,1
i think the mbp ticks off more of the nice - to - have boxes for me than the xps13 overall .,1
the mbp does not run as hot as my old white mb did .,0
"the battery life is really pretty comparable ( slightly more with the mbp , and i can obtain info on app energy usage a bit easier imo ) .",1
the trackpad is the ultimate difference - maker for me .,0
"the mbp trackpad is best in class and if you are not using a mouse , this makes a huge difference .",1
the mbp 13 ` ` is plenty mobile .,1
"the one drawback is that it uses more energy than most apps on the mbp ( especially word , not so much with excel or ppt ) , so i ' ve been using google docs / drive in safari ( chrome is also an energy hog ) if i ' m away from a power source and the task is light enough .",-1
"adobe apps are also power hogs , but that is to be expected .",0
"i also feel like apple hides too much under the hood from the user , but i suppose you can still work around that if you are so inclined .",0
an unexpected benefit for me has been the iphone / mbp integration .,1
i love the airdrop and receiving imessages on my mbp ( although it can cut into productivity if you ' re not careful ) .,1
"overall , it ' s a great machine .",1
"it ' ll be interesting to see what the revisions are in 2016 , but i was worried about the shallow keys of the new macbook making their way to the mbp and the loss of port options with a new revision , so i am very happy to have this now .",1
it works great !,1
i updated it to high sierra and it ' s running smoothly so far .,1
"battery life is good , screen looks fine , and all of the keys and ports are functional .",1
the only thing i didn ' t like is the big dent on the front of the lid .,-1
this was a outstanding upgrade from the early 2013 650m model .,1
"as far as gaming performance , the m370x does quite well .",1
i predict based on tests performed by other users on youtube with battlefield 4 ( frostbyte 3 engine ) that this machine will perform well with the impending starwars battlefront ( also frostbyte 3 ) .,1
"with the windows 10 / directx 12 improvements , frostbite 3 games will do very well on this machine at 1050p graphics / medium / low with the new starwars game .",1
"nothing beats the quality of the mac os x as well , which is one of the main reasons for this purchase .",1
but i fed up with the price it cost to upgrade the product as well as the software .,-1
i ventured back to the macbook pro world and purchased this model after much research .,1
one of the first things i noticed after firing up this device was how quiet and effortlessly it performs all tasks that i ask of it .,1
- love the trackpad .,1
- performance and processing speed are bar none,1
- retina display is nice but not mind blowing as other have suggested,0
"all - in - all , i have been extremely satisfied so far with this purchase and am enjoying my not - so - cutting edge purchase .",1
"the screen is crisp and clear , easy to set up .",1
great deal on a great computer !,1
my first mac and i ' m in love .,1
so far it ' s running smooth with no issues as if it was new .,1
computer looked excellent .,1
it came in a regular brown box and the power cord was a bit scratched .,-1
but the mac looked and worked great .,1
"this is the first macbook i have ever purchased , i wish i had purchased sooner .",0
"thought all apple products are over priced , i wouldn ' t have anything else .",-1
laptop in perfect condition .,1
"i like the size of the laptop , and it ' s processing speed .",1
laptop is as described .,1
"it didn ' t come with the box but it came with the charger and so far , i ' ve only been using for a few days , but i have no issues with the item at all .",1
looks brand new and the battery life lasts a long time ( see photos ),1
i always was a huge fan of apple and i always thought the price on the macbook pros were too steep but i finally took the plunge and i ' m satisfied .,-1
"the seller ' s customer service was great very fast response time and the computer came packaged really well , in original box and it great shape .",1
if you ' re thinking about this or the 2016 version i ' d stick with this for now .,1
the 13 ` ` is a good weight .,1
screen resolution super ( retina ) .,1
the display is beautiful and the amount if software you get makes it worth the price !,1
it boots up instantaneously .,1
my father is very satisfied with this laptop,1
it came exactly as advertised .,1
"it is a small , light , powerful device that until 2016 seemed custom fit for content creators , photographers , and other such lines of work or hobbies .",1
"the new pro model is very light and compact , and can easily be carried around with you every day .",1
the display is amazing and the new force click trackpad is an awesome addition .,1
"it ' s a little weird at first , knowing that the button isn ' t actually moving when you click down , but you definitely get used to it .",0
"the mac pro is also very fast , and i have only experienced the rainbow wheel once or twice whenever i was on a website that wasn ' t responding .",1
but so far this laptop has been up to its expectations .,1
has a long battery life .,1
i like everything about this macpro .,1
"stable , long battery life , and great build .",1
"as of now , highly recommended refurbished products",1
the new retina is amazing and the speed is awesome .,1
"the only detail that i have to reproach is that the connection cables are a little dirty , but in acceptable condition .",0
love this mac book pro .,1
well macbook is no less than expected .,1
"this new generation macbook has a fast processor , great retina display , 13 inch high resolution screen , great compatibility and many more .",1
crisp screen .,1
i have had this computer for almost a year now and i love it .,1
i have used it for business and school and wouldn ' t want any other computer for the job .,1
i love this laptop .,1
mac really knows how to build a good dev laptop,1
im thrilled with my mac .,1
"i was a bit apprehensive at first will ordering such an expensive item online , but it was delivered in perfect new condition .",-1
"i think i will forever be a mac user from now on , it is an awesome product !",1
"wonderful machine fast , clean , solid i have to said that this guy i fell from my hands the first day i use , goes to the floor and nothing happens screen is perfect and nothing is damage !",1
this is my first macbook pro i ' m impress !,1
i love this mac .,1
"received on time and the packaging assured that if those ups drivers dropped my computer , it would t damage it .",1
the computer itself is as stated and i received at a price my husband and i were both happy with .,1
fast shipping .,1
what an excellent computer .,1
as a refurbished item it was indistinguishable from a new item .,1
condition even better then i expect .,1
the mac works like a new one .,1
"great laptop , excellent quality , definitely meets my expectations .",1
the macbook was delivered soon and it is exactly as described,1
i love this computer .,1
it has been great for everything i ' ve done .,1
i would like to have more storage capacity but the ssd boots this laptop up in a matter of seconds .,1
great price for a brand new product .,1
now i keep seeing headlines for bad battery life and other woes for the 2016 edition and feel extra satisfied by my choice .,-1
"slim , very fast , great screen , lightweight , solid state drives , great battery ( even though it burns the battery life when i play my flight simulator due to processing demands of the graphics ! )",1
it ' s a great computer .,1
the pro is by far the best .,1
the retina screen does an excellent job of not tiring my eyes after a long day of computer work .,1
i am very pleased with this version of the mac and hope i never have to upgrade again because this is by far the best !,1
if you ' re coming from a pc you ' ll love the battery .,1
1 - itunes match ( $ 25 / yr i believe ) keeps all of your music synced across all of your ios devices with no limit .,1
the screen display is absolutely amazing and totally blows me away .,1
"january 21 , 2016 update : i love this laptop even more than before .",1
"feel totally comfortable with it , and will never go back to a pc .",1
"it has been super easy to become familiar with it ; the more i use it , the more i appreciate it !",1
this laptop is incredibly lightweight and slim ( ultimately won me over after years of lugging around a whopping 5lb levono ) .,1
i hate the new keyboard the newer version comes with .,-1
the 2015 version has the old keyboard with keys that you can actually type on without the fear of a typo every other word .,1
the battery life ( so far ) is fairly true to the description and has lasted me 8 hours of constant use .,1
it ' s so much faster and the mac os is so much more secure .,1
"love my new computer , there were some knicks on the outside but it works well",1
this was exactly what i needed and it performs as new which is exactly what i expected as well .,1
"i ' ve only had it for one day and the set up was easy , and all items delivered were present , will update over time !",1
"so i decided to use some of my christmas money to buy myself this one , and so far this is pretty awesome !",1
"it ' s a different computer overall due to the way you control certain things and what not , but that hasn ' t been a big deal .",0
i also like the display .,1
the speakers on this model are really nice as well .,1
it ' s also awesome how the charger for this computer is magnetic .,1
"overall , i ' m very happy i chose this model .",1
definitely glad i purchased my mac .,1
the display clarity is outstanding .,1
i am fully satisfied with the purchase and communication with the seller was great .,1
i love the mac .,1
"i love it , it is as shown on the picture",1
it is a great laptop !,1
beautiful display and runs fast !,1
a great laptop !,1
awsome machine .,1
as expected from apple !,1
"the best laptop i ever had including amazing retina display , light weighted , fast booting , high performance and prolong battery time .",1
great item by apple as usual .,1
works exactly like it ' s supposed to work !,1
a wonderful device with extremely clear display .,1
one year later and the laptop is still in great condition !,1
the macbook pro is everything i hoped for and more .,1
just made the move from pc to macbook !,0
"love my macbook , beautiful and use daily !",1
my 17 year old granddaughter loves it .,1
the rig works better than advertised .,1
it was as they advertised .,1
great little laptop .,1
"five stars with no doubt , thanks apple for such product",1
i would highly recommend this product if you want to get into music production like myself .,1
"elegant design combined good performance , this laptop is almost flawless .",1
"small light portable , excellent screen , very fast performance and soo quiet , does this have a fan ?",1
the battery lasts me days .,1
"this is a lovely product that i recommend for general use as a student , less so for gaming and storing whatnot .",1
love it .,1
"i love the mac laptops , they are durable , reliable , light with all day battery and have awesome designs .",1
i love it .,1
i am so excited about it and hope to see more of your products in the future !,1
the best product .,1
excellent packaging .,1
"fast delivery , brand new as expected .",1
the keyboard and os takes some getting used to .,0
"good quality all around hardware + software , of course that is what apple is known for .",1
very nicely packed in original box .,1
computer came in good condition and at a good price .,1
"great value for money , the notebook is as good as new .",1
works great !,1
"i have had this laptop for about a month now and every time i turn it on , i am still blown away !",1
"when i first got it in the mail and i opened it up and turned it on for the first time , i was a little speechless because the retina display looks so good !",1
very clean computer everything looks brand new !,1
"what ' s not to like , it ' s an amazing machine .",1
also the battery life is great and lasts me an entire day ( i ' m usually on it all day too ),1
"great purchase , quick shipping .",1
excellent quality and very fast delivery .,1
this laptop is absolutely everything i imagined .,1
the computer is very beautiful and very light .,1
the retina display is stunning .,1
this computer is amazing .,1
the battery life is outstanding .,1
the internal flash memory is like greased lightning .,1
"i was super worried that touching the keyboard when it was in tablet mode would cause it to switch back to laptop mode , but it looks like once you move the screen back past like 180 degrees , it goes into full touchscreen .",-1
"if you purchase this product , go into it with realistic expectations and patience getting familiar with the setup and you ' ll probably love it , too !",1
"i bought this chromebook on the prime day deal , but even without $ 60 off it would still have been worth the money .",1
it looks way better in person than in the pictures .,1
"since you have access to android apps on the google play store , you don ' t have to rely solely on the chrome browser to access apps .",0
i haven ' t had issues with the track pad as others have .,0
"i also bought a wireless mouse , which paired perfectly .",1
"do your research , learn how to optimize your experience , and you ' ll love it !",1
"well , i have to say , i ' m fairly impressed with my new chrome flipbook !",1
and the blue mail email app handles my multiple emails from multiple domains .,1
i ' ve used it for 3 days and still have n ' t plugged it in !,1
"it ' s fast , secure , easy to use ( even as a tech geek , it ' s nice knowing something ' s just going to work ) .",1
"i ' m a writer , and this has easily become my main computer for both work and play ( google docs easily replaces word , and android apps make it much better for gaming than i originally expected ) .",1
the battery life is great ( i get about 9 hours ) .,1
"my only complaint is the click on the touchpad feels a little cheap , but i just use ` ` tap to click ` ` so it ' s not an issue .",-1
"overall i love this machine , and all my computers will probably be chromebooks in the future .",1
my desktop runs all my video editing software for my bigger and most demanding projects and my laptop is great for editing video and running pc games in places other than my home ( like school ! ),1
"i wanted something i could work on my writing projects on the go , so i paid the $ 250 for this thing .",0
when i recieved the item i was amazed at the quality of it .,1
"but just at first glance , this thing is top quality .",1
nothing on it feels cheap at all .,1
"all of it feels very strudy ( within reason ) and has a nice , modern look and feel to it .",1
i feel like this will look good in any decade .,1
i boot it up and notice quickly the display seems to be 720p ( or something close ) but for what i need this thing to do .,0
"the touchscreen and the hotkeys along the top take some getting used to but i was quickly in the google play store , downloading all the apps i have on my phone and linking them to my accounts .",-1
` ` this thing is neat . ` `,1
i was supposed to use this to write !,0
i use some other apps but nothing is quite the same for my workflow .,-1
i thought the gizmo was neat but i was disappointed that i couldn ' t really use it the way i wanted to it that regards .,-1
i was using my whole $ 3k desktop on this little $ 250 laptop and it ran flawlessly !,1
i could even watch videos and game from the laptop itself ( to an extent ) .,1
that is just incredible .,1
for $ 250 i can control my $ 3000 pc anywhere .,1
this thing is the ultimate mobile workhorse .,1
this is the ultimate tablet .,1
this thing is amazing .,1
"buy it for school , buy it for home , buy on for the grandkids .",1
"i chose this one mainly because of the full size keyboard , larger screen , and full size hdmi .",1
"you can right - click by using two fingers to tap the track pad at the same time ( or 2 fingers on the touchpad , using one of them to press press down / click the touchpad ) .",0
"the feel of the touchpad is not as smooth ( frictionless ) as others i have used , but it ' s not terrible either .",0
"however , it does feel like a sturdy hinge .",1
the screen does not wobble as there is a good amount of friction holding it where you put it .,0
reserve your judgement until you ' ve updated the software entirely .,0
giving lower stars for not realizing its limited capabilities is your own fault .,0
i love the feel of a lighter os and can do many tasks using google / web based apps .,1
i can live with the so - so touchpad since the rest of it feels solid / sturdy .,1
"yes , this chromebook comes with the android app store pre - installed .",0
"although 4 gigs of ram doesn ' t seem like a lot to some of us , because of the simple software , it is very fast with no lag .",1
"my wife upgraded from the 2 gigs of ram version to this , and it seems like there is more than twice the performance .",1
the screen is pleasantly satisfying with the touch screen and foldability .,1
"the power button is no longer on the keyboard , but is instead on the side of the machine which is fine .",1
"this machine , through her minimum time of using it , has already been so much faster for her to use .",1
i ' m amazed at this product that has the same build as the other acer chromebooks .,1
"we are happy to be selling her old one we bought just a few months ago , in replacement of this new r11 !",1
"1st , i was shocked at how easy it was to set up .",1
in preparation for becoming a chromebook user i had purchased a 256 gig memory card and moved all my laptop files to it .,0
it worked great .,1
every app i have downloaded from the google app store has worked perfectly .,1
"amazon , as well as the google suite of docs , sheets , slides , and photos work great .",1
"there nwere complaints regarding the lousy screen resolution , as well as the mouse pad not working well .",-1
this by far has been the easiest to set up and use .,1
it is fast and simple .,1
gates and this machine allows me to do this .,1
"of course , i have only had this acer for a week .",0
if something happens within 30 days i will return it but i will get another one .,0
i am very happy with my chromebook !,1
very poor experience .,-1
"customer service did not respond for almost a week , and i ended up paying + $ 20 in shipping to return the device .",-1
"the screen just went blank and would not shut down , stayed in a cycle that would bring up some gray screen and then just turn itself into sleep mode .",-1
it has been just over 6 months since purchasing this and it already needs a 500 fix .,-1
this model has a defect .,-1
the screen blacks out and apple has refused to fix it .,-1
they have refused to fix it to date .,-1
not sure what the deal is but extremely disappointed .,-1
the other weird thing is a ` ` popping ` ` noise i keep getting when i use the tracking pad .,-1
it ' s a clicking or popping noise that comes from the left side speaker .,-1
less than 90 days and the screen stopped working .,-1
i contacted the seller and they seemed like they could care less .,-1
i bought this to save me money and now i wasted $ 700 to still have to go out and buy a new one .,-1
however there are many issues with this computer on start up that really bothered me and made my experience with a mac not that great,-1
"as soon as i turned on the computer , it froze as i tried to sync information .",-1
"another problem i had was when i awakened my computer from sleeping , the wifi would not work .",-1
"i fixed it , however it took intensive research to fix it .",-1
"so if you want to buy this computer , make sure you ' re prepared for some early booting issues .",-1
i packaged it right back up and sent it back the same day i got it .,-1
i had this laptop for a little over a year and it worked well at first .,1
i only used it work my college school work and light browsing .,0
apple told me that they ca n ' t order those screws so i basically threw my money away on this laptop .,-1
"unfortunately this macbook is part of the ` ` staingate ` ` series , i would not suggest to buy this as apple doesn ' t seem to care about customers buying a faulty product that is very expensive",-1
"unfortunately , before i purchased it , i failed to research what the thunderbolt ports were .",-1
as it turned out the thunderbolt ports are of no use .,-1
the machine looks amazing doesn ' t it !,1
"as the hours in your day wind down , they will tell you to go here and there , call you back , ultimately to find out that , ` ` i ' m sorry but we do not cover that ` ` .",-1
"apple should ashamed to be associated with this cheap , lousy , clearly inferior , plastic nightmare - but then again , maybe that is exactly what they do want , so profits soar .",-1
"i ' m pretty sure i ordered the biggest size , and i got the smaller one , but whatever it shipped fast and it works great .",1
have not heard any complaints about the product .,1
apple told me to upgrade it to just buy the new one when they release it .,-1
disappointed in reliability : used in a small business operated by my wife .,-1
"if known ahead of time , we would have not purchased this machine .",-1
apple used to make a wonderful product but my computer is now a useless paperweight until i have a new charger sent to me .,-1
stop working the macbook pro,-1
hold on before you decide to pay $ 2500 for this laptop .,-1
"it turns out that it ' s not a stain , but the anti - reflective coating coming off .",-1
i went to the apple store and they said it would be 900 to fix .,-1
great aesthetics .,1
"transferring files from a non - iphone phone , like android is extremely annoying .",-1
"everytime the charger is on the laptop , my left wrist will always get stung when it touches the side of the chassis .",-1
ive researched this and it is very common and apple says it ' s normal .,-1
- high resolution / dpi screen,1
- thin and relatively lite weight,1
- fans run more often on the latest version .,-1
"- for such a premium price , this is definitely the worst purchase quality wise that i have made .",-1
the quality is terrible ( both versions ) for such a pricey product .,-1
this is not a new unit .,-1
i made the mistake of thinking it was new .,-1
i have had nothing but problems with my macbook connecting to my wifi from the beginning .,-1
"absolutly horrible product , cheap components make for unreliable products , but when the nearest service location is 50 + miles away i wonder how much apple truly cares ?",-1
it started throwing i / o errors ( log viewer ) and occasionally ` ` system error - 50 ` ` would show .,-1
"it would power on , start to boot , then abruptly power down .",-1
my macbook pro 15 ” can overheating when some do it !,-1
your new retina screen will get stains on it from the top layer seperating and or dead pixels .,-1
overpriced low quality product .,-1
"my laptop is affected by the staingate issue and apple denied responsibility , saying that it ' s a cosmetic problem caused by improper cleaning , yet there are thousands of reports on this .",-1
apple should be embarrassed .,-1
"* excellent form factor , extremely portable while remaining a serious pro computer",1
* incredible display,1
* good keyboard,1
* decent selection of ports for its size,1
* very weak wifi reception from the built - in antenna .,-1
the machine is near - unusable out of the box .,-1
it stutters and pauses as you switch windows or use the ` ` show all windows ` ` or ` ` show desktop ` ` functions .,-1
"you have to ` ` increase contrast ` ` and ` ` reduce transparency ` ` in the accessibility options to make it perform ok , but with a ui that looks like s * * * .",-1
"paradoxically , this laptop is a ` ` pro ` ` .",-1
"sadly , apple is moving into fashion - - your laptop is no longer a performing athlete .",-1
had it for a week now and still finding things it can not do .,-1
this is a great computer .,1
but how expensive it is .,-1
i can not leave now because i need my computer fixed .,-1
beware that stains in the coating of the display have been detected in all of the macbook retina editions .,-1
"however , after a couple of months the keyboard case started to crack at the corner .",-1
update - 7 / 30 / 18 - exactly the same issue has occurred with a crack in the keyboard cover on the opposite side .,-1
this device would be a good choice if it weren ' t so poorly constructed .,1
i originally purchased this at the beginning of april after about a week it stopped charging ( would receive ` ` low power charger ` ` connected message and not charge ) .,-1
i ended up returning it .,-1
my second asus chromebook has died .,-1
but asus chromebooks have a fatsl flaw .,-1
"i was so excited to buy the asus chromebook , and bought some for my grandchildren .",1
"but this asus , who offered so much & rated over 4 stars , turned to a black screen , just over a month after i received it .",-1
"lo and behold , i hadn ' t read quite all of the 1 * reviews : the worst was a teacher who had ordered so many for her several classes and said ` ` i think the problem is with the motherboard .",-1
we ' ve got android nougat on beta running pretty well now .,1
"the stock video player misses audio on a lot of movies , and using the vlc app ( android ) is super buggy ( frequently freezes and shuts down ) .",-1
it ' s increasingly disappointing to see the much - hyped play access is still nonexistent .,-1
"needless to say , android / play rollout is being managed very , very poorly .",-1
"for the moment , please note - * * * this product no longer works with the google play store in stable or beta * * * and there is no communication about what we can expect , or when .",-1
i will update this review when there is further progress - i believe this is a 5 star product but the updates are reducing my confidence in the software .,1
"some of you will remember the asus “ transformer ” line of android tablets - pretty respectable tablets with tegra processors , decent builds , and most importantly - a keyboard dock that was far , far superior to any on - screen keyboard options .",1
i remember them fondly .,1
"the asus c302 is , for me , the dream of that perfect asus tablet / keyboard combo made real .",1
"- the m3 processor is * plenty * of power for all chrome , video , and android requirements .",1
that ' s how confident i am in the asus after 10 days .,1
"- android apps work rather well , even if not perfectly yet .",1
"i ' m still using chrome for almost all native google apps , however , since chrome tabs / apps simply work better / faster / easier than their android counterparts .",1
the c302 is clean and feels solid .,1
this is a nice perk to save battery life and for folks who like to read / / browse late at night in bed and do n ' t want the backlighting on .,1
this is now my fastest - charging device .,1
it charges insanely fast .,1
- jstorrent works nicely for any torrenting needs .,1
"- android support is only in beta mode as of february 5 , 2017 .",-1
i ' ll end the review simply saying i ' m very happy overall with my purchase !,1
great machine out of the box .,1
but after only a couple of days the thing just turned off and won ' t turn back on again .,-1
"i tired every remedy found online , and even got in touch with asus tech support who just said ` ` send it back ` ` .",-1
and apparently amazon is experiencing a supply shortage because my replacement isn ' t expected until sometime between jan 11th to feb 5th !,-1
the c302 is a great machine .,1
"as of today , they can not give me a date on the return of my chromebook .",-1
"clearly , this is a company that can not handle repairs in a timely matter .",-1
this is a dreadful little piece of machinery .,-1
i ' ve had mine 10 months and the motherboard has crapped out twice already .,-1
"bought it for a xmas gift , dead in less than 3 months .",-1
edit : just shy of owning 2 for 9 months now and both are experiencing touch screen failure problems .,-1
"one of them keeps sliding the touchscreen randomly back and forth , and the other one disables a top portion of the screen randomly .",-1
"i loved this chromebook , it worked great for six months .",1
"now the romance is over ; it won ' t charge , and my only option is to send it in for service , a 10 - day event not including shipping there and back .",-1
the build quality is fantastic .,1
the thing that made me return it was the trackpad .,-1
the trackpad was very glitchy .,-1
i had the trackpad speed maxed out and it still was bugging out .,-1
overall i like the portability and battery life on this device .,1
my disappointment begins with the fact that chromeos is not touch - ready and most websites will not consider touch interface for desktop mode websites .,-1
"google ' s own services like google docs , drive , and gmail don ' t respond well to touch screen gestures often leaving me in despair .",-1
"aside from the larger capacity , it hasn ' t lived up to some of the other hardware i ' ve used .",-1
• super thin and light weight,1
• bright screen with good colors,1
• occasionally hangs for 10 - 30 seconds with no response from keyboard or trackpad,-1
at first i was totally stoked on this chromebook .,1
"aluminum outer body , usb c charging from either side of the chrombooke , backit keyboard , nice screen resolution and fast processor .",1
"then about 3 months in , it quit charging from the supplied fast charger .",-1
"i can plug it in and put it back to sleep and it will charge , but if i haven ' t woken it up it won ' t begin to charge .",-1
the speaker crackling i can live with as i just need to logout and re - log in to fix it for about a week .,0
"the charging issue i can live with as well , even though it is annoying .",-1
"i would look elsewhere for a convertible chrombook , this one just doesn ' t quite live up expectactions .",-1
the design is very cool .,1
it has a good blend of functionality and performance at a great price point .,1
"i especially loved the high ( er ) resolution display , compared to most other chromebooks .",1
wifi was pretty bad .,-1
"linux worked fairly well , and i was pretty pleased with it overall .",1
"as of the time of writing , the audio drivers are still not working , but i typically don ' t care for that anyways .",-1
but it lost the coil whine roulette - - badly .,-1
"long story short , i loved asus and have been buying them for years .",1
"i ' m in the us and asus wanted to charge me $ 60 cad for diagnosis only , and then said it would be an additional estimated $ 315 for repair .",-1
it ' s a real asus hasn ' t been able to improve their customer service and support and won ' t fix this issue .,-1
it just is missing a lot of other features that i wanted in a notebook,-1
vlc media player from the chrome app store did not have the capability to play any media from my external ssd that was in a usb 3 .,-1
"the machine is easy to use , snappy , and everything the reviewers say .",1
the main bad for this particular variant is that google is no longer going to support it with updates .,-1
"so be forwarded , if you buy this , you are jumping right into a machine that won ' t get updates anymore ( which is something most chromebook owners want and a feature that makes them better than android and it ' s fragmented market ) .",-1
many apps won ' t download and work on it like they do on an ellipsis .,-1
asus has not responded to numerous request for an update of the status of repair .,-1
"while under the warranty , asus sent me a fedex account with no instructions .",-1
but today i noticed it ' s cracking ( ref : pics ) .,-1
i bought this as a gift and was incredibly disappointed as it did n ' t even turn on after the initial charging .,-1
very disappointed and i have n ' t even had the product for 12 hours .,-1
the product came highly recommended .,1
yay amazon customer service they replaced it immediately for me no questions asked .,1
"the second one arrived , i had it from end of may june , to september started to notice the a key was a bit unresponsive at times .",-1
it gets rave reviews both on the ' net and amazon .,1
"in many ways , the computer has lived up to my expectations .",1
it is the nicest chrome computer i have ever owned .,1
it has one serious flaw though which is that the audio out can not drive headphones ( or earbuds ) adequately .,-1
"even with the volume turned up all the way , the sound is very low which means that you have a poor soundstage .",-1
the one star is for warranty support .,1
after about 60 days use the power adapter / charger stopped working .,-1
- i love the chromebook overall,1
- it freezes up depending on the program you use and you have to restart it .,-1
- battery sucks .,-1
- horrible customer service .,-1
build quality is excellent ( was .,1
online support from asus says they only repair not replace .,-1
"this is my 3rd chromebook and it is , by far , the flakiest one i ' ve had .",-1
"the bluetooth on it drops connections on a regular basis and the wifi is slow , slow , slow to connect on a regular basis .",-1
the space bar on the keyboard is inconsistent .,-1
my main gripe is incompatibility with amazon prime videos and gogo .,-1
about half of my home automation apps also do not work .,-1
it works well for internet browsing and e - mail but i was hoping for much more .,1
i also hate the square rather than rounded edges .,-1
this makes it uncomfortable holding it in tablet mode .,-1
"maybe i just got a lemon , but i decided to return this product after having it for less than two hours .",-1
"as a computer , for typing and using internet in general , this computer is good .",1
"however , for using it as a tablet / computer with streaming , it seems to only work half the time .",-1
"netflix and hulu seem to be working for the most part so far , but amazon prime and xfinity stream are both having issues .",-1
"i have had the computer for four months , and my computer suddenly wo n ' t turn .",-1
"so i call asus customer support , and received some of the worst customer service ever .",-1
it was terrible .,-1
very odd operating system .,-1
asus support seems to want to make this an accidental damage instead of warranty .,-1
i can ' t recommend purchasing this based on what happens if you need support .,-1
"the build quality , screen and keyboard are terrific .",-1
"unfortunately , the downfall for me are the speakers .",-1
they just don ' t get loud enough and that ' s crucial for me since i watch a lot of youtube and listen to music while doing other things on the machine .,-1
it surfs the internet fast .,1
the touch screen broke four months after i purchased it .,-1
the key board and mouse pad are not very sensitive .,-1
the sound and screen quality is low .,-1
"disappointing battery life , even with light use i have to recharge every 4 - 5 hours ( at best ) .",-1
relatively small screen with high resolution makes reading the screen difficult .,-1
android ` ` the computer will recognize your cellphone ` ` system never works .,-1
"otherwise , build quality is very good , starts quickly , very light .",1
when it works it ' s a great device .,1
"sadly after barely a year old it crashes all the time , the touch screen rarely works , and the track pad stops working until a reboot on occasion .",-1
asus support is responsive but ineffective .,1
i will never buy another asus after this experience .,-1
"i bought this less than 6 months ago , and now it won ' t charge unless it ' s asleep .",-1
"it ' s basically a useless brick , with shoddy hardware .",-1
don ' t let them scam you .,-1
oh and the customer service is garbage .,1
great little machine while it was functioning 100 % .,1
very unsatisfied with warranty service .,-1
my shiny speedy asus chromebook froze after only one month of use and i am returning it today for a full refund .,-1
cursor won ' t move and touchscreen won ' t work and from reading about this online i am not alone with this issue .,-1
extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my husband .,-1
"i bought this chrome book based on the high ratings , however i feel the quality just is n ' t up to par for the price i paid .",-1
"today , it stopped powering on .",-1
i ' ve been chatting with asus support for the past half hour and they make the sloth from zootopia look speedy .,-1
so sad to report that after only a few weeks my asus chromebook has a hairline fracture .,-1
the touch screen never seemed to work properly and now i understand why .,-1
"this was a splurge for myself , which i rarely do , and i ' m so disappointed that it turned out like this .",-1
"this is a great machine in many ways - - and with crouton could run full ubuntu , which made it a great little machine to write code on and deploy to a server .",1
"nice screen , nice feel .",1
overall this chromebook worked well and was reliable .,1
the wifi card recently died after 14 months .,-1
"now , my wifi connectivity goes up and down with regularity .",-1
not super confident this asus unit will last half that long .,0
it ' s not worth what i paid for it .,-1
i will never buy an apple product again .,-1
beautiful machine .,1
app game ( simpsons tapped out ) ( i know don ' t judge ) lags at every moment .,-1
chromebook is 2 months old and charger stopped working .,-1
called customer service twice only to learn that i need to return old charger ( i pay $ 15 to return ) .,-1
there is a buzzing sound that comes from inside of the keyboard .,-1
"excellent product , feels like quality all the way around .",1
"product keyboard just stopped working after 6 months of use - called asus , and you have to ship it off for a two weeks repair .",-1
the chromebook seems to be working fine now and my daughter does love it .,1
this is exactly what i needed in a laptop .,1
"however , the speakers are already starting to crackle , and i haven ' t even had the thing for a week .",-1
"i still love the laptop , i ' m just a bit disappointed by this and i hope it ' s the only issue i see .",0
the battery is far below what i expected .,-1
"moreover i ' m quite upset because it seems amazon will not pay me back the shipping fees , which for me amount to about 100 $ as i live in france .",-1
the track pad has now stopped working .,-1
it is my only device with this issue in my home .,-1
it keeps disconnecting .,-1
"in total , it took 4 updates to access the google play store - - completely unacceptable !",-1
"up until this point , asus chromebooks have been my favorite .",1
"i chose this device because of its power , app store , and a few other features trading off the option for an onboard stylus and improved screen resolution .",1
it also has a great backlit keyboard .,1
i love how i can charge my laptop on both sides of the device .,1
wifi sketchy to nonexistent .,-1
i much suspect that google ' s half baked sustem is at fault .,-1
not only is the touchpad not great in use but it also feels poorly made .,-1
i have been happy with this purchase .,-1
10 months in my battery will no longer charge .,-1
the first week i had my chromebook it locked up .,-1
"i opened the box after ordering on black friday , and the machine wouldn ' t charge .",-1
the battery stopped charging after 3 months .,-1
customer service is difficult .,-1
"also battery life is max 8 hours , not 10 .",-1
"however , the resolution could be higher , the scaling is bad , the colors are a bit washy , the weight is off as said earlier , the keys are kinda awkward , travel could be more , and the keys start squeaking soon after use",-1
"but , now i realize the design is flawed .",-1
and the worst customer service ever !,-1
"this laptop was supposed to be in ` ` like new ` ` condition but unfortunately , it was not .",-1
after updating the software i noticed that the was a lot of backlight bleeding from the display .,-1
"upon further inspection , i had noticed that one of the side speakers was pushed in and the plastic surrounding it had a crack .",-1
"only three months in , and the laptop won ' t charge .",-1
something wrong with the battery .,-1
the keyboard broke after three months and it has been difficult to get any help from the manufacturer .,-1
the second the screen did not rotate .,-1
and the screen was changing like creazy .,-1
but right out the box the battery will not charge .,-1
this worked ok for about a year and then just totally died .,1
had the chromebook for 1month and 5 days and it stopped charging .,-1
very good in all respects except a very important one which is the pathetic sound volume especially during movie playback .,-1
a thoroughly disappointing machine .,-1
mouse and wi - fi never functioned correctly .,-1
machine periodically crashed .,-1
"after seven months , the usb - c ports stopped charging .",-1
now the hole thing crashed out of nowhere and i ' m going to lose everything i had on it .,-1
"+ nice , large screen",1
+ good battery life,1
+ play store compatibility is available now .,1
"some apps don ' t play well yet , but should with time .",0
"- 3 months after purchase , the chromebook has issues with the screen flickering constantly and has been sent in to asus for repairs",-1
- the rma process needs improvement - buyer must pay to return the product for repair .,-1
chromebooks are a waste of time / money .,-1
so disappointing to receive the laptop and it wouldn ' t even power up .,-1
"when in use , the lower screen is flickering .",-1
"i contacted asus support twice so far , however , they are not able to provide a solution to choppy video .",-1
the performance of my chromebook is the issue .,-1
video playback is poor with the amazon prime video player .,-1
great device until battery won ' t charge .,1
really disappointing results with sound volume and volume consistency .,-1
"the aluminum body looks great , but feels cheap and thin .",1
speakers are weak and the volume range tops off half way .,-1
i just fear for the long term ruggedness of the exterior .,-1
"after 3 weeks using this flip , i am quite happy with its performance , design .",1
"it ' s easy to use , convenient .",1
"the keyboard is comfortable to type with backlit , screen quality is good enough for me .",1
"thin , light , cool are what i feel when holding it and carry around .",1
"the reason for 3 stars is due to that i have a rickety feeling when touching middle of the right side frame of the screen , it doesn ' t affect to screen , i am not sure it is faulty or normal , kind of uncomfortable to hold in tablet mode .",-1
the screen is nice .,1
google play support is lip service only .,-1
the problem dinvolves the headphone jack .,-1
it would not charge at all !,-1
this is a great laptop .,1
it has a weird smell that ' s why i ' m giving it 3 stars .,-1
i wanted a large screen laptop with backlit keyboard and a lot of memory and this computer does not disappoint .,1
the notebook is decent .,1
"it is easy to use , light , and you have the ability to download apps for just about any need .",1
"however , the bluetooth is a nightmare .",-1
it just stopped working in the middle of my paper i was writing .,-1
"the screen is good , the tablet mode is nice , and the keyboard has a good feel .",1
but after three charge cycles the screen started vibrating vigorously from side - to - side .,-1
"the tablet is good also , however can ' t they design something that covers the keyboard during tablet mode .",0
it is the best chromebook that i have ever used .,1
both forward and rear facing cameras would be nice too .,1
then the power cord went bad and i had to pay $ 50 for a new one .,-1
"it ' s fine as a computer , but the lack of a real guest account made it not workable as a family room media machine .",-1
hardware is still pretty sound .,1
but i ' m growing ever more disenchanted with the core m3 processing speed .,-1
"also , the batterly life that is reported by industry affiliates is way off .",-1
"google locked me out because after an update , my keyboard output was not as it should have been ( some keys were inverted ) .",-1
"when i go to type something , it sticks and will not release .",-1
i will probably be sending it back as it seems too complicated .,-1
by far this is the most disappointing experiences that i ever had doing online shopping .,-1
at this stage i am disappointed than raging up and it wasn ' t the end yet the keyboard didn ' t work at all .,-1
nice chromebook .,1
but seemed very poorly made for the money .,-1
it is may 14 and it ' s not connecting to wifi .,-1
"it won ' t hold a charge for longer than an hour , my son has to relay on this piece of cheap equipment primarily for taking notes and doing schoolwork .",-1
manufacturing seems unreliable .,-1
"also , often , the device simply would not power on .",-1
loved this chromebook .,1
"first one i received , the space bar got stuck and returned it for a replacement .",-1
"now , the headphone jack produces low volume at 10 percent capacity .",-1
the laptop is pretty lightweight .,1
cons : the speakers make a loud muffled white noise while playing music on occasion .,-1
"on the one i received , the trackpad is hard to press down and seems to rub against the palm rest casing .",-1
screen is good .,1
"it is not up to my expectations , it produces some kind of sound when you play something on youtube ( from its keyboard ) perhaps !",-1
my main complain involves terrible battery life .,-1
speakers were messed up when turned on and the return did it still have n ' t processed even though it ' s been several weeks .,-1
very poor battery life .,-1
"very touchy touch screen , too sensitive .",-1
this is the worst computer i have ever owned .,-1
"however , after having the computer for about 4 months it suddenly died one day and would not turn on .",-1
"udpate : after talking to tech support , i found out that they made the wrong repair .",-1
worst customer service experience in years .,-1
the screen is great and the unit is fast .,1
very disappointed in very bad tech support .,-1
this is a piece of garbage .,-1
then tonight ( april 29th ) my daughter says it ' s not charging .,-1
"bad touchpad , jerky movement , imprecise , no controls to improve .",-1
wifi radio loses signal too frequently .,-1
it began to shut down and restart all on it ' s own - continuously .,-1
"it sounded clean and simple , exactly what we need .",1
"very very very very weak battery and the play store is a joke , this thing still needs a lot of work to become a serious product .",-1
"beyond that , less than a week into the ownership trial , the power _ supply failed .",-1
"but basic stuff needs to be properly engineered and designed , and this machine had two huge problems right out of the gate .",-1
"good laptop , but not great .",1
the screen is only pretty good .,1
"the touchpad is above average , but not great .",1
why does this company keep releasing faulty units from the production line ?,-1
2 - right arrow key not stabilized within the body and comes off .,-1
- display glass not glued well on one side .,-1
screen not aligned perfectly .,-1
i purchased this asus chromebook in may of 2018 and initially loved it .,1
this is my third and last chromebook .,-1
it wouldn ' t charge .,-1
i really wanted to like this chromebook .,-1
"unfortunately , the touchscreen is extremely insensitive , making it unusable .",-1
everything was good for a few days after receiving the product .,1
"the unit is sleek , nice and the keyboard feels tactily right .",1
"but , when software compatibility began stacking up , it became a nogo for me .",-1
"very fast product , but with this kind of technology it ' s not possible to use a program , that i work ( minitab ) .",1
i ' m very disappointed with my purchase,-1
cpu and ram were running low .,-1
gpu wasn ' t drawing a lot of power because i was playing world of warcraft on the recommended settings .,0
got my replacement recently and i haven ' t had any major issues so far .,0
i ' m still worried about the quality of capacitor and conductor inside this thing .,-1
"overall , it is a great laptop for the price .",1
"the cpu runs super fast and doesn ' t start utilizing its full potential until you start doing things like installation of applications , but the memory usage sits around 40 - 50 % the most of the time .",1
"my fan can get it as low as 82 - 83 degrees , consistently , while idle or gaming .",1
"the steelsteries keyboard feels great and looks awesome , but the keyboard surface of the laptop can get warm while sitting idle or gaming even when i have a fan pushing cold air underneath the laptop .",1
the monitor is bright and colorful .,1
i don ' t see any problems with it .,1
"keeping the msi software is optional , a few of these are useful like burnrecovery to make a backup of your version of windows just in case anything happens .",1
i updated the realtek audio drivers and tested it using razer surround ' s audio drivers ; it still did not fix it .,-1
do not purchase this laptop .,-1
"i had previouslu bought an msi mobo which refused to boot unless windows 10 was the os , but i had worked around all of those problems .",-1
"i should have known better : msi has boot issues , no way around it .",-1
it simply refuses to boot .,-1
yet it fails to boot .,-1
it is apparent the hard drive has failed yet again .,-1
"upon accepting a graphics driver update , the whole laptop froze .",-1
"i ' ve never owned an msi laptop and if i can help it , this one is going back and i will never own one again .",-1
"* * update - so i closed and opened this laptop again , and the simple act of putting it to sleep and waking it up , as usual , caused a problem .",-1
"out of the box , gorgeous laptop .",1
keyboard problems too .,-1
so far great machine .,1
the laptop ran quite swiftly !,1
"the temperatures were good , and the overall responsiveness of the system was fine .",1
game performance was fantastic .,1
"the intel rst driver ( for the hybrid drive ) version is old , and causes rare system lockups .",-1
"further , the msi dragon center ( default software on the installation ) caused a blue screen which lead to me having to factory reset .",-1
"msi used to have a driver installer by disk that would install all the proper drivers in the right order , so you ' d have the perfect configuration .",1
"however , the laptop has no dvd drive , and no such driver dvd was provided .",-1
"it ' s possible i got bad hardware by chance , but all of the issues being directly traceable to drivers suggests the issues were all driver - related .",-1
second where the heck is my other 8 gigs of ram ?,-1
"its fast , light weight , quiet , and looks easy to add additional ram and hdd ' s .",1
i think this msi product will be a part of my business for a long time .,1
i bought this laptop on black friday for $ 700 and i ' m debating returning it because i ' ve had quite a few issues .,-1
"im actually wondering if there is an issue with the speakers , it ' s so bad .",-1
the battery life is terrible .,-1
"again , i wonder if my unit is defective because most reviews talk about this laptop having a 6 + hour battery life .",-1
"not sure it is related , but when i open facebook , aaaallllll the messages open simultaneously .",-1
the unit is whisper quiet and hasn ' t gotten hot no matter how hard i push it .,1
i ' ve never had a computer as fast as this .,1
"whether i ' m playing games or video editing , or web design , it doesn ' t hesitate .",1
"i ' m not a huge gamer , but it can run crysis with full mods on ultra settings and doesn ' t make so much as a light hum .",1
"honestly , i ' m debating returning this laptop .",-1
your mileage may vary but it ' s been a headache for me since i bought it .,-1
the battery on this computer is not very good i feel like i always have to have it plugged in .,-1
"bad battery , speaker and touchpad",-1
"it ' s fast , but the whole thing is wearing out quickly .",1
"however , when i received this laptop , it stopped booting to windows after 3 days .",-1
the ssd is not work after 4 month,-1
"the keyboard / mousepad isn ' t super comfortable for casual use ( like on your lap , sitting on a couch ) , so i think it is more meant to be used more or less exclusively for gaming at a desk or table .",-1
"it is heavy , but that is to be expected with a laptop like this one .",0
"however , i tried to power it up today and kept receiving an error message right at startup that was a ` ` system boot violation ` ` .",-1
", the advertised ram is 16gb and in the answer questions section has answers from the manufacturer saying ` ` this will have 16gb of memory ! ` `",-1
i did not get what i originally paid for .,-1
"i don ' t know if i got a defective model or what , but something has gone wrong every time i boot up my computer .",-1
not to mention it is quite clunky and large .,-1
just that it seems that the hard drive doesn ' t work properly .,-1
it only comes with 8 gb or ram not 16 .,-1
"the responses in the faq are wrong , this does not have 16 gb of ram , almost gave it a 1 star bexause of this reason .",-1
"mousepad is a little wonky if you ' re not deliberate with your fingers , recommend using a mouse .",-1
"keyboard layout is not the best , do not like that i have to press the function key to raise or lower the volume / brightness on the arrow keys .",0
"the cooler boost button is cool , also like the fan placement and how the laptop is elevated in the back .",1
"in essence , if you want a gaming pc , this one will do the job .",1
this laptop is actually horrible .,-1
everything about the experience has been terrible .,-1
the most recent incident is the sound wo n ' t work .,-1
i had this for all of a day before it began to have severe issues i set it back to factory settings and that worked for a time but it eventually had an issue with system 32 .,-1
"within two months , there were too many issues / bugs with the os .",-1
"the screen would freeze , requiring a hard shutdown .",-1
the screen is surprisingly poor .,-1
"it took hours to restore to factory default settings , and it crashed once again days later .",-1
"this is completely unacceptable for any computer to have this recurring issue , let alone a mid - tier performance gaming laptop .",-1
i am still disastified even if this was a replacement,-1
"the last straw happened recently when i put it to sleep and it just wouldn ' t wake up - or rather it would try , and then spend the next several hours in a repair / analyzing mode that didn ' t actually do anything .",-1
i have had nothing but problems with it since i bought it .,-1
"and finally today , 4 months after purchasing it , it has completely crashed .",-1
the computer can not repair whatever disc issues it has .,-1
this was the worst computer ever .,-1
do not buy this computer !,-1
"so far , it all works well .",1
"today was my heaviest use of the new computer , and no less than 20 times have i had to undo / unscroll / unselect / unzoom .",-1
multiple system crashes .,-1
but let me not recommend it .,-1
was installing an update and the computer went black .,-1
"i bought this originally a few months back , died within a week .",-1
"so called msi tech support , went through the troubleshooting and of course they could not fix it .",-1
eventually it bricked and died 3 days after any possible refund could be made .,-1
"if you want something that would last longer than a month , look somewhere else , as this is an absolute rip - off .",-1
it ' s a very fast laptop .,1
i use it for gaming and it runs rocket league at max graphics and it looks amazing !,1
i definitely recommend this if you are looking for a good gaming laptop .,1
i have had to wipe this pc about 8 times in the short 2 months i have owned it .,-1
"its functionality is fine and for a gaming computer it performs well , don ' t connect an hdmi cable to it though , this will fry it , also don ' t turn it off cause you have a good chance of having to reset your laptop to factory settings .",1
"i can no longer return it and have wasted $ 850 , the support refuses to get back in touch or provide any form of civility .",-1
i used this laptop mainly to play counterstrike and pubg which it did just fine until something got corrupted with the optane drive .,-1
"however , not to impressed with msi ' s customer support .",-1
"playing a movie couldn ' t even last the duration of the movie on the battery , again , disappointing .",-1
its a sleek racecar of a machine and ran the new insurgency : sandstorm with ease .,1
if you buy this machine - be prepared for it to break .,-1
it randomly shuts down all programs running and goes back to the desktop like nothing was going on .,-1
stay far away from this laptop !,-1
"only been using it for about a week , continuously getting the error that it can not connect to speakers .",-1
note that this laptop is only 45 daysish old .,-1
"cpu and gpu are good , ram is good and i like the keyboard .",1
port options are nice as well .,1
the picture quality seems .,-1
fans can get loud .,-1
speakers sound tinny .,-1
this laptop is my first time using the intel optane thing and after this i can not recommend it .,-1
it is freaking painful how long it can take games to load with that hard drive .,-1
"i absolutely love this laptop , it looks great , its quality is amazing and can handle so many games without any lag involved .",1
"its battery life is really good , and the led lights are nice .",1
"however , after weeks of having this laptop , its outgoes a bunch of problems .",-1
the 1st problem that occurred is it kept shutting on and off .,-1
"2nd problem was the game card was damaged and 3rd problem was youtube wouldn ' t work again , and the search bar on the laptop wasnt working .",-1
this bios is horrible .,-1
what was even worse was the customer service .,-1
"purchased it the first time , thought it was faulty hardware , returned for a replacement of the exact same , and it had the exact problems .",-1
i bought this product for black friday and i have been using it steadily since then .,0
i have been using it for about a month and the screen already is having little white streaks on it without anything to cause it .,-1
the inside is great but i feel like it won ' t last long enough before the outside crumbles .,1
"the computer was a 50 - 50 chance to boot from day one , but we figured it needed to run updates and get settled .",-1
this was a christmas present and now we ' re scrambling because it sucks .,-1
suddenly the laptop goes to sleep and doesn ' t wake up .,-1
i bought this in august and i have had to completely wipe 2x and rollback after every critical update since november .,-1
definitely has issues with windows 10 .,-1
system shutdown problems every month .,-1
tech support is useless .,-1
"update : i have had this computer for about 3 months now , and it is full of problems .",-1
"i got this laptop 2 days ago and it says plugged in , not charged .",-1
i replug and restarted the laptop 3 times and it still does n ' t work .,-1
"the fan is almost always on even if you have it set to automatic , although it ' s not loud .",-1
microphone is really low .,-1
absolutely terrible quality control to not even get past the initial boot .,-1
"had purchase this for my child to surf the net ; i ' d noticed ( and i can easily reproduce the problem ) , whenever her game needs to download an update , it seems like no data is coming down , while the harddrive activity ( read and write ) is very high .",-1
not a good quality laptop .,-1
"this laptop has good hardware specs , but the screen has very poor color coverage : 59 % .",-1
"it was crashing , it would restart and then the monitor would not work until i plugged it into an external one , and even then it would usually require a restart again .",-1
i returned this one as well .,-1
it is not a great build .,-1
i had high hopes but sadly i had to return the second as well .,-1
to bad the battery did n ' t work out .,-1
"when it works , it works well .",1
but i ' ve had consistent issues with this laptop since i ' ve bought it .,-1
"* * * update * * * this laptop has already bit the dust ; it crashed with a blue screen of death , and then refused to power back on .",-1
"what is the point of downloading games , files , anything , when a couple of weeks later it will crash and fail to recover !",-1
i bought this because it had a good price .,1
then suddenly it needs a software update which made my laptop crash .,-1
the computer literally blue screened on the second day because system 32 was corrupt .,-1
when it does run it runs great .,1
do not buy this .,-1
"will never buy an msi product again , and will tell every person i know to stay far away .",-1
it stopped working a week after i recieved it .,-1
don ' t recommend it .,-1
"i bought this computer a bit over two months ago for my son ' s college and after installing the windows update , it crashed !",-1
do n ' t buy this laptop or brand .,-1
i barely do anything on it and it is a complete garbage can of a laptop .,-1
the screen will not work .,-1
now the start up is failing .,-1
i wouldn ' t recommend this product .,-1
i do not recommend this to anyone in the gaming labtop market .,-1
update review : having had this laptop for a few months it has had a bad crash from a recent windows update .,-1
very let down by the reliability of this machine .,-1
i will never buy msi again and urge others to re - think about this brand .,-1
it gets used everyday for work all day long and some light gaming in the evening .,0
so far the performance has been spectacular !,1
"8 + lbs , this one is right under 5 so it makes it nice and portable .",1
this is my first msi and if it stays great i will be a returning customer .,1
the battery life on the laptop is disappointing and the webcam doesn ' t work it .,-1
"received this laptop on july 30 , 2018 and by august 5 , 2018 , not even 1 week later , it has stopped working .",-1
msi should be ashamed at putting out products they know have issues with no intent of correcting the problem during the building and testing phase .,-1
i can not recommend any products from this company and encourage everyone to avoid them .,-1
good gaming computer .,-1
"for the price i paid , this laptop can ' t be beat .",1
"for $ 499 the laptop is a bargain , but you should only buy if you you plan to add an ssd in the near future .",1
+ the colour is a beautiful grey and not purple as reviewed by other users,1
+ fingerprint sensor is accurate,1
- power button next to delete button ?,-1
"- caps lock without a led notification , not so clever .",-1
"it does have an ips screen , battery life is going strong , and no touch pad issues .",1
definitely a steal at the price i bought this for .,1
"initial impression is that this thing is super light , almost 1 / 2 the weight of my asus ux501vw but with the same screen dimensions .",1
"keyboard feels firm and no flex , screen is nice for the price range .",1
good sound quality,1
horrible keyboard flex,-1
the max screen brightness isn ' t very bright,-1
no backlit keyboard,-1
horrible light bleed from the top edge of the screen,-1
no ventilation at bottom of laptop,-1
the laptop looks beautiful and the 8th gen intel core is a performance powerhouse .,1
the laptop is a little bigger than i had hoped and heavier than i expected it to feel .,-1
to me back - lighting on a keyboard is a make or break so i might return the laptop though ( bought it because i could have sworn i read it was backlit when i purchased it ) .,-1
"overall , its a pretty good looking laptop that falls short of feeling truly premium ( backlit keyboard , cheap quality screen , keyboard flex ) .",1
"the display is brilliant , has the whitest whites and the blackest blacks , contrast is excellent and the colors are outstanding .",1
"not only is it a hdd , but its a slow one .",-1
- keyboard isn ' t back - lit,-1
- no cd / dvd reader ( but who uses them nowadays anyway ),0
highly recommend this laptop for mobile workers .,1
the ram is expandable ; i bought 8 gb additional and installed myself fairly easily .,1
quiet keyboard .,1
"ok battery life , 4 or 5 hours of continuous use , but i ' m never far away from a plug so no big deal really .",0
cons : delete key near the power button ( oops ! ),-1
internal graphics only ; not recommended for high intensity gaming or 3d modeling .,-1
this has been a really good computer for the money .,1
it is fast and lightweight .,1
"i do n ' t game , so not idea how that would go , but it ' s probably not bad .",0
the only thing i don ' t like is that the power button sits beside the delete key .,-1
it ' s a good system and has loads of space available for storage :,1
this computer functions very well as a gaming laptop for the price .,1
the laptop runs smoothly and renders larger games quickly .,1
"there are only two cons , the sound quality and the overheating .",-1
all in all a great cheap gaming laptop that even with the cons i am not dissatisfied with the product .,1
"i like this laptop , for a 15 ` ` monitor laptop with i5 - 8250u cpu , the weight is acceptable for me to carry it to work between different office .",1
"the monitor is good , and graphic chip is enough for my office work , internet browsing and video streaming , don ' t think about what game it can play , i won ' t expect intel graphic chip can do a lot , if you want a gaming laptop , find some model with independent graphic chip , if you want a cheap laptop but can play computer game , you should wake up from the dream .",1
"just one question , now i am running the os on the ssd and the original 1tb harddisk just for storing file , its boot up and start softwares very fast , but operating with file explore is very slow , i already set the file explore not open the quick access but it still slow , rename will effective after seconds , copy file and even right click sometimes need wait for minutes , who know how can i solve it ?",-1
awesome computer .,1
as everyone else says ; the keyboard is not backlit .,-1
the original hdd in this laptop has some speed limitations for load up .,-1
"the specs are good , its even faster since i added an additional 8b ram , making it a total of 16gb .",1
"the 15 ` ` screen is big and nice , this will make my examinations go much faster .",1
"it ' s completely quiet , no heat whatsoever , and very fast !",1
good screen .,1
perfect laptop for everyday use .,1
"i ' ve used it to do some basic video editing , developing applications , and some gaming and it ' s handled it all fine .",1
ca n ' t go wrong with an asus !,1
"i plugged it back in , let it fully charge as directed and have had no problems since .",0
"the screen on this looks great , the bezels aren ' t noticeable .",1
"well , wifi worked instantly without bugs .",1
i ' ve had the laptop for a full day now and i can say it is quite impressive .,1
the screen is also crisp and the speakers are punchy for a laptop .,1
this is a great notebook .,1
"on the flip side , this asus is very fast with minimal bloatware that is easy to get rid of .",1
battery life is between 4 to 7 hours depending on what i ' m doing .,0
i bought this laptop for software development .,0
my only complaint is that the trackpad is just awful .,-1
"overall , if you just need a computer to do basic software development , remote work , or browse the internet , it ' s perfectly fine .",1
"it ' s pretty light , too , so it ' s easy to travel with .",1
the build quality is .,0
i am much more productive with this machine .,1
"for me , it ' s been fantastic .",1
would have been 5 stars if the keyboard was back light and the finger print reader had linux drivers .,-1
this by far one of the best laptops i ' ve ever purchased .,1
( coughlenovocough ) this is a beast .,1
good for students that carry it from class to class .,1
"also , the power button placement is not very good .",-1
it bothered me that i could accidentally press it while typing .,-1
i ' m a programmer and it can run all programs perfectly without delay and i don ' t have to worry about it .,1
the notebook is very well built and it could easily pass as a high - end machine .,1
asus support is horrible .,-1
the support website is incompetent .,-1
this is a decent laptop no thanks to asus support .,1
"this thing is now light , fast and powerful enough to allow me to spin up some virtual machines to help with my study courses .",1
screen color is excellent .,1
"fast , thin , great battery life .",1
monitor looks crisp .,1
"no dvd drive , but who uses those anymore anyway ?",0
the power _ supply is awesome .,1
only thing i ' d change would be the hard drive .,-1
processer is blazing fast ( competes with 7th gen i7 hq line - check cpu benchmark ) .,1
only complaint that i took a star off for is that the edge you rest your arms on is not rounded off and it is uncomfortable to rest on them for while .,-1
display is ok not great .,0
nice computer for the price .,1
quick startup and has a nice display which is matte .,1
this is a great laptop .,1
i really love the laptop !,1
it works really well with my art programs and runs a lot better !,1
"don ' t know what was going on , but , it seems like this laptop is working fine .",1
i bought the computer on january 2018 and so far i am really enjoying it .,1
"the computer has been running the programs such as matlab , mathematics , diamond , among others without problem .",1
for me has been worth the $ 500 for the computer .,1
and it ' s light which is a big plus since i carry it to school .,1
i guess the computer is quite okay for the price they are asking for it .,1
"after using this for 7 months , i can say this is one of the better laptops i have owned .",1
i used this laptop for 2 months without upgrading it .,0
"purchased this mid november , because of the 8th gen i5 , and other good specs for the great price .",1
"hdd , agree didn ' t sound good .",-1
"after that , it ' s actually been running well .",1
"screen , i have it running at the brightest setting and looks fine .",1
the hdd sounds more like scraping on tin rather than fine steel .,-1
keyboard does seem a little off size as i seem to often be one key offset when get in typing position .,-1
internet runs well .,1
downloading is very fast over wifi .,1
i don ' t have need for the backlit keyboard .,0
i ended up returning it even after getting a credit because the wireless did not work well and was extremely slow .,-1
"everything is amazing , love the look and everything about it until now .",1
what this tells me is that the hdmi port on my chromebook is defective .,-1
i read a lot about people getting doa versions of this product from the reviews and thought i got a pretty good one until now .,1
manufactures need to quality check their products before sending them out .,-1
"after logging in to the replacement , the screen flashes black every fives seconds and restart the chrome browser .",-1
chromebook is not a writer ' s friend .,-1
the build - quality is pretty good .,1
"biggest gripe , no backlights on the keyboard .",-1
the keyboard is okay .,0
the trackpad is mediocre in use .,0
"most of the time it works very well and one is subject to the vagaries of the various apps , browser , etc .",1
i find the screen resolution to be very good for video .,1
i can ' t really testify to its battery - life as i have not used it to the point where the battery is totally dissipated .,0
"all in all , i could live with this as my sole device if i had to",0
after turning it on and logging into my google account i was getting an error when trying to run chrome .,-1
"aside from that , it ' s a functioning web browser .",1
"we ' ll it ' s been a few weeks now with this chromebook now , aside from the initial issue , no problems .",0
"they ' re like a little - known gem , practically unknown in my area .",1
i have mixed feelings about this acer chromebook .,0
"like the other one i borrowed , this one feels streamlined and easy to use .",1
it ' s easy find and delete pics and files you ' ve downloaded .,1
"they have a low - quality , hard plastic feel and a weird textured grain to them .",-1
i wouldn ' t want to do any extensive typing on it .,-1
the touchpad is hard and clunky .,-1
even using it a bit makes my hands / wrist uncomfortable .,-1
doing general internet surfing is a breeze on this laptop .,1
"overall , it works well and is easy to use .",1
it ' s still good for basic internet usage .,1
"pros : streamlined and simple ; easy to use overall ; easy to find / delete pics & files ; good price ; looks nice from the outside , with the lid down ; good 14 ` ` screen size that ' s surprisingly hard to find",1
"cons : webcam doesn ' t have video - only takes pics ; awful , uncomfortable keyboard & trackpad ; chromebook extensions are lacking and don ' t address / make up for the limitations of this chromebook ; a bit heavy and clunky ; hard to figure out google cloud print",-1
also on this model the ssd is not replaceable .,-1
i went online and found that the 1 year acer warranty had already expired .,0
"also upon turning it on , i got a blue screen .",-1
the trackpad is awful as are most acer trackpads .,-1
this happened 7 times within 20 minutes when i was working on something .,-1
"i am returning immediately , no patience for this .",-1
everything lagged and the screen flickered .,-1
i just received the computer back from repairs and it worked for about 2 days and the same problem started happening again .,-1
unfortunately this chromebook is very sluggish .,-1
i wouldn ' t recommend this chromebook .,-1
"not only did i get the laptop with a dented corner , the screen constantly flickers and cuts out on occasion , the entire laptop freezes for no discernible reason , and the mouse has completely stopped working twice .",-1
computer arrived doa .,-1
the keys and mouse pad are responsive and comfortable to use .,1
"now my main complaint is that is it very slow , especially for a new computer !",-1
"big learning curve , would hate to see someone older try and figure it out .",-1
the drag and drop works poorly which is very annoying .,-1
"on the upside , the internet is lightning fast and it interfaces with tv through hdmi which is great , is bluetooth compatible and has two usb ports .",1
overall a good buy .,1
acer had no answer for that question .,-1
"next day during a video froze and just kept looping one section as it froze , and then froze and made a horrible loud scratching noise .",-1
"completely aggravated , sending this crap back as soon as i hear from them .",-1
computer was used very little and stopped working after 6 months,-1
"technical support was easy to reach , but not able to stop the problem i was having .",-1
support got quite unpleasant when i ask about replacement .,-1
"other than that , i like it , and this is my first chromebook .",1
but this one was a piece of trash .,-1
power cord broke within the first two weeks of use .,-1
otherwise computer seems okay .,0
i ' ve had it for less than two months it randomly shuts down .,-1
trackpad keeps breaking .,-1
acer support is awful .,-1
"other people online seem to have this same problem with the trackpad , but acer pretends they have never heard of it .",-1
third time in 5 months that the touchpad became unresponsive .,-1
very low quality build and quality support .,-1
"was able to get past setting up the log in info , but then once you log in the screen continuously goes black and comes back on and goes black and comes back on ; continuous cycle .",-1
"i ' m thinking i got a dud , so i ' ll update this review once i can get it resolved hopefully with a replacement .",-1
"one of the two usb ports is defective , which is an enormous pain .",-1
"also , chromeos does not allow color / temperature calibration of the display device .",-1
"i gave it 3 out of 5 stars , because there is no sd card slot !",-1
"nice screen and keyboard , touch pad is great .",1
then it just rebooted without prompt .,-1
it ' s already bricked and i did n ' t even use it for more than one day .,-1
very disappointed with the wireless radio in this chromebook .,-1
it ' s terrible .,-1
"i could have bought a new pc for the money , but figured the slim chromebook was handy , and the word on line was it was great for exactly the reasons i wanted it , as a wireless entertainment center .",1
i wish i could give it away at this point .,-1
acer ' s customer service is by far the worst .,-1
the track pad is one of the best i have seen for a non - apple touch pad .,1
picks up wireless signals weakly !,-1
"the screen flickers , freezes , and the machine even restarts itself on some occasions .",-1
the screen display isn ' t bright at all !,-1
even the keyboard is fantastic .,1
"overall , worst chromebook ever and i can ' t wait until it dies !",-1
i would not recommend this as a primary chromebook or even to buy it at all .,-1
update - this thing frustrated me so much over the past month that i just threw it in the trash ( where it belongs ) .,-1
"personally , i would steer clear of this chromebook .",-1
it started to get slow a week ago .,-1
now the curser / track pad is gone .,-1
terrible product .,-1
"if you use wix to edit websites the scroll bar will not appear once you enter editor page , thus making it impossible to design / build / update websites .",-1
i was disappointed with the touch pad would stick and when it broke loose it over shot the target .,-1
do not buy this machine if you ' re hoping to run android apps .,-1
after charging the unit for 2 hours i discovered that the unit will only operate while the charger is connected .,-1
keys are a bit thin and have an odd feel to them .,-1
this unit is a great compromise between powerful cpu and gpu with good battery life .,1
- timeout on keyboard backlight not adjustable .,-1
acer refused to pay for shipping it back to them for warranty repairs .,-1
"that seemed to correct problem , but problem returned next day and the battery would only charge up to 1 % with charger plugged in .",-1
monitor went out 35 days after receiving .,-1
powered it down and back up a few time to check boot times and now ibhave huge black lines running down the screen .,-1
display driver fails 3x a day .,-1
loses wifi connection every hour .,-1
"they are simply unreliable , poorly made laptops .",-1
its a hardware issue .,-1
"the picture was very bright and clear , the back - lit keyboard was a very nice feature , and it seemed like a good value for the price .",1
the internet download speed with the acer was akin to an old dial - up modem speed .,-1
"as of this writing , the computer ' s dedicated video card is completely non - functional , the computer routinely switches off in the middle of executing a process , and i can ' t even use the hdmi out port .",-1
however with that being said i bought this laptop about 3 days ago and it ' s already not working .,-1
i called acer tech support but nothing worked .,-1
will not recommend it .,-1
it is an ok laptop .,0
the problem with it is that it freezes from time to time .,-1
"this looks too big , it ' s just 1 day of use so far this is my review .",-1
my computer was used on average a couple hours a day .,0
"11 months after the purchase , it died .",-1
"it worked great , no issues besides the mouse began to freeze when the computer was idled for too long .",-1
"first one had a white line on the screen , then went and got a replacement , not even six months into this one and the graphics card failed .",-1
"the problem is a complete lack of local hardware support in the us unless you happen to live in temple , tx .",-1
i am giving this a one star because of its faulty design .,-1
the screen sits too close to the keyboard and you will end up with scratches on the screen .,-1
laptop failed after only six months of use .,-1
"looking past the bsod problem , the battery is internal so you can ' t just pop it off , you need access the mobo just to replace it .",-1
"this laptop ' s construction is cheap and flimsy , the battery is not removable and the back case is nearly impossible to take off without damaging it .",-1
it would not start up after 2 months of purchase and then re - set button didn ' t work .,-1
its a good computer for the price but it needs to work awhile without crashing within 6 months .,1
"the touchpad is quite sensitive i ' ve noticed , not a big issue to me .",0
"i will keep my rating at 3 stars , as the issues with the screen quality / shine - and volume / brightness keys being unusable and nonexistent , to be large issues for me .",-1
"the laptop build is cheap looking and basic , but functional to say the least while i save up money .",1
"i will say , however , that the screen is kind of awful .",-1
"it looks awful , feels awful .",-1
"overall i have to remind myself that this laptop is only 600 dollars , and with certain gains i ' ll lose some things unless i ' m willing to spend out of budget .",0
this item is two months old and the power button repeatedly does not work .,-1
screen broke 2 weeks after having it .,-1
i had this laptop repaired within the first 6 months of owning it .,-1
works good but right click on mouse pad wont wok have to use external mouse,1
"when i play a game , there is noise on the screen .",-1
the laptop itself seemed fine at first .,1
but the backlit keyboard was no longer lighting - up and the computer would no longer turn - on or boot .,-1
"i left it plugged in to charge for the night and tried it again the next morning , with the same results of not being able to turn it back on .",-1
"i hate to knock acer as they ' re the only brand i ' ve ever purchased and this is the first major issue i ' ve ever had with them , but it was frustrating spending that much time charging and almost finishing the configurations and set - up of a brand - new product and then not being able to turn it on to use it .",-1
"then i called amazon - acer again , the customer service was good !",1
"overall this is a very capable machine , better life is great as well .",1
"not sure if this is simply a deal accident , but my ssd failed within 4 months .",-1
"but the battery was giving erroneous feedback and getting too hot while charging , the keyboard was way too sensitive for me , and the cover / lid was a really cheaply made .",-1
"i got the computer working fine i set everything up linked it to my phone ect , then i had steam messages open , discord open and watching youtube and the screen again froze completely no audio no nothing just a frozen screen displaying youtube .",-1
it had hard failure after a month and i had to send it our for a service .,-1
power turning on failed .,-1
computer wo n ' t turn on have had it less then a year .,-1
the laptop died after just one month .,-1
"poor screen quality , extremely dim , lacks clarity , slow photo uploads .",-1
"received it , launched up a game , cpu reaches 99 degrees celsius , game crashes .",-1
"twice in 10 days i had an issue , pointer , where they said turn it over and put a pin in it .",-1
"it ' s far too early in this machine ' s life to be encountering problems , the company has very poor customer service , and i would strongly recommend against purchasing .",-1
"the computer hold its ground , but it has specs to be a killer .",0
barely have it for 6 months and everything ' s going haywire .,-1
now i ca n ' t even get into my laptop because the startup is all jacked up .,-1
"however , the 1 - star review is due to the advertising with the computer .",-1
battery is not as long,-1
buyer beware - computer is complete trash .,-1
it just freezes up on you .,-1
super off balance with respect to screen .,-1
keyboard lighting is primitive and keeps shutting off .,-1
"the battery life is around 2 hrs , not 10 + as advertised .",-1
i have had good luck with acer products but this pc was my 1st time i needed them for technical support .,-1
i call acer support and after an hour they can not help me .,-1
bought an acer computer that did not work .,-1
i ' ve called apple support numerous times and was never asked if i had the ability to read words as i ' m actually reading words .,-1
"constantly got the blue screen , already tryed everything to fix it .",-1
the seller doesn ' t reply my e - mails,-1
i ' ve had this for 3 days and so far the laptop is fine .,1
i ' m seriously considering returning it !,-1
i don ' t want bluetooth speakers .,-1
i would not buy this again !,-1
good touchpad,1
below medium build quality,-1
usb ports are too hard to plug and unplug,-1
comes with hdd and this makes this laptop very slow,-1
about 4 hours of battery,0
maintenance and opening case is too hard,-1
"in contrast of that , this laptop ' s cpu is very powerful .",1
"on the other hand , it is not an easy task to open and replace hdd .",-1
i don ' t understand this kind of design .,-1
i can enjoy the real potential of this laptop .,1
1 ) the delete button is right next to the power button,-1
2 ) slow start up and performance given,-1
"it ' s fast at processing , fast for web browsing and has a quick startup .",1
"in seconds , even with an hdd it ' s still starts up in seconds .",1
the fingerprint sensor is a nice touch and the color and feel of the laptop material is also nice .,1
there is really no excuse why it can ' t have one .,-1
it has the specs but that ' s it ' s main downfall .,-1
"15 ` ` screen , full sized keyboard and speed fast enough for some low quality games such as lol .",1
"it ' s light and thin , and overall the screen is pretty good .",1
"the hdd that comes with the computer is slow and loud , in fact the computer is not usable by todays standard , it ' s terribly slow .",-1
"after the ssd upgrade , the computer is very fast .",1
the build quality is cheap .,-1
everything is plastic .,-1
the hard drive sounds like a distant lawn mower .,-1
this thing is slow !,-1
i ' m trying to do online college college courses with it and it gets hung up in some intimate nevernever land of unresponsiveness .,-1
- the audio for this laptop was poorly planned out .,-1
so the audio can easily be muffled .,-1
"- even so those are forgivable offenses compared to the next and worst thing , the touchpad .",-1
this laptop ' s tocuhpad is by far the worst i have ever used .,-1
"i bought 2 , one stopped working after 9 months , was sent for ` ` repair ` ` it wasn ' t came right back with the same issue .",-1
"the other one had the same issue after 9 months of use , wasn ' t used right away when purchased .",-1
"the customer service is the worst i have ever experienced , asking the same questions over and over , not helpful at all .",-1
do not buy !,-1
"today tried to turned it on , but to a blank screen !",-1
this is a painfully slow computer .,-1
- acceptable amount of flex,1
- fingerprint reader is working well,1
- track pad is accurate,1
- screen looks good,1
- took literally 5 + hours for windows update / setup,-1
- the webcam is a bad joke,-1
the hard drive is definitely slow .,-1
"after only a little over a month , it totally died and will not work at all .",-1
extremely slow .,-1
very junky,-1
sound went out in less than a week .,-1
this item cost me money .,-1
"after running through the setup wizard , the laptop failed to boot .",-1
i eventually returned it .,-1
ordered in november 2017 but used fewer than 100 hours when vertical red line appeared on monitor .,-1
"they are clearly working with more than one person at a time , and not effective multi - taskers .",-1
laptop screen goes blank after four weeks minimally used .,-1
then it would not boot up .,-1
screen turn black and won ' t turn on within a month rarely use .,-1
- excellent cpu,1
- good ram,1
then the light bleed becomes annoying and distracting .,-1
- the hard drive is really slow and really loud .,-1
beware this product seems to have no quality control .,-1
i was using it and the screen started to flicker and then went completely dim .,-1
also tech support gave incorrect product info !,-1
it ' s a good enough laptop .,1
customer service told me it ' s faulty,-1
power plug doesn ' t fit well - connection is erratic .,-1
the vivobook f510ua is a great laptop with fantastic specs .,1
however i ' m happy to report that the keyboard is great and i ' ve already gotten use to it .,1
with my first day of use everything was terribly slow and updates took hours .,-1
be prepared to wait a good five hours give or take until the system runs smoother .,1
2 ssd as it will not fit the slot available .,-1
2 stars taken for horrible sound quality,-1
this computer completely shut down after 2 months .,-1
i can ' t get it to work at all .,-1
it ' s one of the worst laptops i ' ve ever had .,-1
this is junk .,-1
it is going on 3 hours now and is only 17 % done .,-1
"otherwise , it has everything i can / might / could love .",1
my only other complaint is trackpad sensitivity .,-1
"having win 10 is already a horrible mistake as so , but if you try to install win 8 , drivers won ' t work properly !",-1
"this computer freeze , reboots , and crashes in a regular basis if you ' re trying to do multiple stuff at once .",-1
screen maximum brightness is still not bright enough,-1
two stars because the current laptop i have works great .,1
"very slow , and always hangs",-1
it ' s a pretty good laptop .,1
"nicely sized , thin and portable , the works .",1
the only issue i ' m having is battery life .,-1
"thing says 8 hours , but i can guarantee it ' s not making it past 4 or 5 .",-1
but yeah overall good,1
besides that it runs ok,0
update - dead pixel in middle screen .,-1
"replacement ordered and arrived , upon first ten minutes of use the keyboard stops working and is barely functioning sound on max is extremely undesirable .",-1
second update - speakers no longer work after 1 month of use .,-1
"runs ok , cheapish , good for price i guess",1
the battery broke after just 4 months from baying it am so disappointed with the product,-1
do not buy this laptop .,-1
i returned it twice .,-1
and when it did work it was very slow .,-1
"windows 10 alone runs slow on this but once you install some 3rd party programs like adobe photoshop or illistrator , this laptop is unuseable .",-1
"even having a couple of programs open & running , slows down the overall performance of the system dramatically .",-1
"i ' ve been waiting for this chromebook for some time now and having only had it for about two weeks , i can say that the device and purchase were well worth it .",1
"5 ` ` ips screen that is gorgeous to look at , extremely bright and full 1080p resolution .",1
"a solid little m3 processor , 4gb of ram and 64gb of ssd storage make this machine capable of handling heavy usage and earn it a solid octane 2 .",1
"the surface texture of the case is a satiny paper - like touch , which is both clean and easy to wipe down , but also not so smooth that you have to be concerned with it slipping out of your hand when carrying it .",1
"even with the 2 - in - 1 flip hinge , the device has a solid feel and there ' s very little wobble in the screen while typing .",1
the pop - up keyboard looks just like the android screen keyboard and the orientation detection and capacitive touch screen are snappy and very responsive .,1
one place that does frustrate me in the tablet mode is that chromeos has a number of ui features that don ' t lend themselves to touch interaction .,-1
"it has a glassy - smooth surface that resists finger - prints and goop , is very large , and has a firm but not too - clunky feeling click to it .",1
it takes up more than 1 / 3rd of the palm - area horizontal space and makes thumb - tapping mouse tweaks very easy .,1
"finally , there are the ports .",-1
"- beautiful , bright ips screen with full 1080p resolution",1
- backlit keyboard rocks,1
- battery life is pretty amazing at 10 - 11hrs,1
- 4gb ram cap .,0
- many ui elements are not user - friendly in tablet mode,-1
- port minimalism .,-1
"out of the box , the asus c302ca is a powerhouse for stock chromeos usage .",1
"performance - wise , i can easily have 12 - 24 tabs open simultaneously and see no slow - down in performance .",1
one place that i find lacking in chromeos is the settings management .,-1
for the most - part you don ' t have much freedom to make any significant changes to settings .,-1
- clean and secure operating system that is very lean and gets the most out of the systems modest specs,1
"- with the combination of web - based productivity tools and development apps / services , this chromebook can provide a breadth of very viable usage scenarios without bogging the system down with locally install applications .",1
- android apps and google play store are real game changers for the chromeos landscape .,1
"- boot time , sleep time and wake time are crazy fast .",1
- system settings could be more robust and better organized,0
- tablet - mode still needs some work .,-1
"so , this is where this little chromebook really shines .",1
"apps start very fast , graphics are much more responsive and capable when not being shared with chromeos and there are a number of ways you can tweak the ui / ux to your own liking .",1
"all that being said , you get a lot of bang for the buck with these three enhanced desktop / application options and i use all three in some capacity every day , so don ' t think your ' e isolated to just one approach .",1
"while the stock aluminum case is darn solid enough , it can take scratches easily from things like keys or cable connectors tossed in a bag with it .",1
"d ) a bluetooth mouse - while this unarguably has one of the best trackpads in chromebook land , there are still times you just need the precision of a mouse .",1
"0 type - a low - profile memory stick on a usb - c adaptor , but that would be silly .",-1
it was an excellent machine for the money and it also got me spoiled with its touch screen .,1
this made me realize that arm processors are not ready for desktop - class browsing .,-1
"let me tell you , this thing is snappy .",1
the build quality is nice and the hinge is sturdy .,1
the keyboard also feels nice and the backlighting is great .,1
i use my chromebook a lot in the dark and it ' s a real treat .,1
"while the chromebook pro does have a nice high - resolution 3 : 2 screen and the s - pen ( which is truly a gimmick anyway ) , it has half the storage , shorter battery life , and no backlit keyboard .",-1
this is among the best .,1
"it ' s much smoother with web pages and android apps , and the touch screen is more responsive .",1
"keyboard is a bit nicer , not tons .",1
"for casual use , this will work fine for me .",1
the default scaling 1536x864 looks excellent and sharp to me .,1
"there ' s nothing i do n ' t like about this device , so in order of importance , here ' s what i love about it .",1
"i ' m typing this review in a dark room , and it reminds me how much i love this backlit keyboard .",1
i love how quick this thing is .,1
"this thing is n ' t that fast , but for loading web pages , it ' s pretty close .",1
the brightness and clarity are awesome .,1
"this is quality hardware , and it shows .",1
"it ' s complementary , not revolutionary , which is much more intuitive and useful .",1
"again , this is where the build quality really shines .",1
the microsd slot leaves an inserted card perfectly flush .,1
"this flip 2 really is a fantastic chromebook , and the ability to run android apps only makes it better !",1
"i absolutely love this beyond any computer / tablet device i have purchased in the last 10 years , trust me , i ' ve bought a lot of them along the way .",1
with the power of the internet and all the online productivity products the simplicity of this is fantastic .,1
the addition of the play store puts the device into a sweet spot no other device can come close to matching .,1
this asus chromebook fits the bill .,1
can ' t say enough about my love of this chromebook .,1
then the asus flip c302 came into my life :,0
"speaking of charges , it ' s so nice to be able to use usb c .",1
our phones are usb c so one cable does everything for me .,0
* keyboard * - the keyboard is alright .,0
* track pad * - the trackpad is well done .,1
80 % of the apps it ' s a poor experience .,-1
the asus c302 is the best chromebook you can buy .,1
the touch screen is super responsive and the keyboard is excellent .,1
it runs most of those apps and games beautifully and when combined with a ` ` logitech gamepad f310 ` ` you can play the games with a game controller !,1
overall this is a home run purchase and i can ' t say enough good things about the asus c302 .,1
"i mostly use it for playing a couple of games , surfing the web , managing my calendar / tasks lists , reading e - books , that sort of thing .",0
"the keyboard is small , a little weird and takes some getting used to .",-1
the keyboard is excellent ( and backlit ) .,1
the track pad is excellent .,1
the screen is excellent .,1
this laptop performs in every way .,1
"it ' s light , but also has a good weight to it .",1
"- the touchscreen is very responsive , fast , and so far everything has scaled just fine during use",1
- the hinges are just perfect .,1
- the speakers are to the sides and not underneath so the sound isn ' t muffled when it ' s resting on something other than a flat surface,1
- this chromebook has access to the android beta channel for android apps,0
"and because of the constant usage of higher brightness , the battery does drain faster .",-1
they both pick up oils and such pretty easily .,-1
"as for the asus , it is a wonderful laptop .",1
i have had no issues with the track pad ; it works fine .,1
i have not fully tested battery life but it seems to last about as long as advertised .,1
"one , the display is gorgeous ; watching video is a treat .",1
"however , there is screen glare , even in a normally lit room , not just a brightly lit room .",-1
"i think that the bezels are a smidge thick , but that actually makes perfect sense .",1
it ' s a real treat .,1
"my use experience has been riddled with lag and jitteriness , although using the touchscreen for a moment sorts everything out .",1
the core m3 allows this system to get fast and to stay quiet .,1
"sometimes , under heavy loads , the bottom of the c302 gets warm to the touch , but not to the point of pain .",0
"all the while , it provides one of the fastest web browsing experiences that i ' ve ever experienced .",1
it will take years of bad programming to make this chromebook as slow as my last one got .,-1
2 ) the touchpad is way too wonky - asus needs to fix this asap .,-1
"having had it for just over a month , i have to say i am thoroughly impressed by its versatility and how stable the os is .",1
"on a side note , there is a slight defect on my chromebook as there is some creaking and loose feeling when pressing on the bottom left side of my screen , this can be especially annoying in tablet mode .",-1
"boot up is of course , almost instant .",1
"- excellent keyboard in all aspects - feel , rigidity , and backlight",1
- excellent build quality - aluminium case is solid and has a premium feel,1
- perfect balance of speed and battery life,1
- my only real gripe is that i wish it was .,-1
"other than my hope that it would be light enough to use as a tablet all the time , this is the chromebook i ' ve been wanting for a long time now .",-1
"it ' s extremely useful as a laptop as well as , most of the time at least , a tablet .",1
note : i bought a refurbished / ` ` damaged ` ` model from amazon and it ' s in absolutely flawless condition .,1
"pros : lightweight , fast , portable , great battery life ( 12 .",1
the keyboard and mouse on the asus were frequently rated as good but those on the pixelbook were raved about .,1
the side mounted speakers are clear .,1
the battery life is not anywhere near the advertised 8 hours .,-1
the design and style is topnotch .,1
"boot speed : likewise , very fast -",1
many android apps work conditionally : e .,1
battery life is phenomenal again .,1
"the keyboard is fully sized and comfortable , the key travel is good with great action , backlighting is enough and adaptive .",1
- the aluminum build is firm and solid without feeling cheap .,1
- the screen is great in all aspects .,1
- performance is solid for chromebook use .,1
- battery life is great .,1
everything is either good or excellent in quality .,1
- screen brightness is generally ` ` enough ` ` but maybe not enough for watching dark movies in bright lights .,-1
- speakers can ` ` chatter ` ` after playing youtube videos for a long period of time .,-1
- performance can be stuttering when under heavy load .,-1
"again , overall i believe this is a great laptop with an amazing keyboard .",1
- physically it is appealing looking .,1
"this is smart looking , thin , light weight , and portable .",1
"but , it was packed well and arrived with no damage whatsoever !",1
the one annoyance is that office 365 doesn ' t provide a seamless way to save file offline and sync up when you ' re online .,-1
- the keyboard is great and has a nice gentle / quiet click to it .,1
- the keys themselves don ' t travel that much which i prefer .,1
"- the trackpad , while a little on the small size , has a nice glass smooth finish and it works reliable well .",1
- the touchscreen works great and is very responsive .,1
tablet works just fine though .,1
build quality and design are top notch .,1
i absolutely love this chromebook !,1
"so , i originally purchased this for the travel conveniences .",0
"most of my love for this laptop is based on the operating system but since you get that with every chromebook , i ' ll tell you what i like and dislike about the physical laptop only .",1
"the display is perfect for me , plenty of brightness and a decent resolution .",1
the usb - c ports are nice and i found that a completely dead battery to fully charged time was about an hour .,1
i really liked that this chromebook came with 64gb of space but i really don ' t see how someone may fill that up unless they opt to sync their google drive offline or something .,1
i wish the display was able to go about 1 or 2 clicks brighter and about 1 click darker at the lowest setting .,-1
the speaker volume is decent but the quality of sound is terrible .,-1
the keyboard is awesome .,1
- it ' s a bit heavy in tablet mode .,-1
- i wish the sound quality was better .,0
"performance wise , this is an excellent machine - it has a beautiful touchscreen , plenty of storage , converts to a tablet , and seamlessly connects to the google play store to run any of the millions of android apps available .",1
the customer / warranty service that i received was first class and i am very impressed by asus for this reason alone .,1
"if you are in need of a reliable laptop that is lightweight , fast , and convertible , i highly recommend the asus c302 !",1
i loved the simplicity of chrome os while enjoying the flip aspect of being able to turn it into a reading tablet when i wanted to as well .,1
"this time around , asus released an absolutely refined masterpiece .",1
the c302 is heavier in size and appearance and also significantly better in all aspects .,1
the keyboard traction is clicky and the layout is spaced out well enough for a terrific typing experience .,1
the premium feel combined with the charming simplicity of chrome os really gives it a stunning experience .,1
"so i decided to purchase the asus flip , and so far it has met every one of my nitpicky demanding needs .",1
"build quality is very good , nearing the ` ` excellent ` ` mark , especially for the price .",1
"sound has been fine , except for a few issues with an android app , and that can easily be software related as android is still in infant stages ( or at least toddler ) on chromebooks , and i expect those quirks will smooth out over time as chromebook software is updated on a very regular basis .",-1
the keyboard is very nice for me .,1
"android is running flawlessly so far , barring one minor incident with sound on clash of clans ( which went away on reboot ) .",1
the m3 processor is fast and fluid .,1
"and the backlit keyboard has a very good feel , and great key ` ` travel . ` `",1
"despite the minor case marks , i can heartily recommend this chromebook based on features , design , and operation .",1
"great product build - the quality of this asus chromebook is impressive at any price , but at sub - $ 500 it ' s astounding .",1
"the metal case is really well built , and the fit and finish are virtually perfect .",1
"that said just buy it with confidence , it ' s a top quality product all around , and , it looks and feels that way .",1
the keyboard and touchpad experience are pivotal for a device like this and what asus delivers is very satisfying .,1
the back - lit keyboard is a joy to use and the 1920 x 1080 touchscreen is superb .,1
"this chromebook is light - weight , durable and beautiful .",1
the 360 - degree hinges allow me to make presentations to customers and the battery life is amazing .,1
this little guy fits the bill perfectly .,1
"the touch screen is nice , and i like to use it for free handing things when i need to .",1
this chrome book joins the group and is itself excellent and different .,1
the keyboard is good .,1
the screen is bright and color spread is good .,1
"fast , beautiful display , comfortable keyboard , and the android apps work well ( not great yet , but well ) .",1

- backlit and solid keyboard ( not flimsy or cheap ),1
- touch screen is very accurate,1

the body of the chromebook feels solid due to the aluminium body .,1
trackpad is nice and quiet and responsive .,1
"as soon as i learned about c302 , i decided top bought it .",0
this little chromebook is amazing .,1

screen is nice .,1
i find it to be a little large when used in tablet mode .,-1

the keyboard is awkward to the touch and the internals only has 32gb of hard drive .,-1
the sound isn ' t great on both devices but they ' ll suffice ; at least the asus speakers are side - firing and not coming from the bottom like the pro .,1
so far i absolutely love it .,1

i ' m loving this thing .,1

"yet , compare with other flip - style of chromebooks , the screen is sufficient for me to do my code .",1

chrome os is intuitive and easy to use .,1
"this little silver bullet is compact , functional , and has held up to everything i ' ve thrown at it .",1
chrome extensions are great productivity tools to boot - they help me squeeze the most out of everyday .,1
the reason for a 4 star rating is due to the provided power cord failing to charge within two months .,-1
"the speakers are not great , but bluetooth connection to an external speaker is standard these days and it ' s how we watch movies .",1
"extremely disappointed that you can not run android apps on this chromebook , despite the description stating clearly that you can , and the seller responding to my question regarding this question .",0
other than that i ' m pleased with the performance .,1
"this chromebook is amazing , i have had zero issues with it thus far and i ' ve used it quite extensively during the semester .",1
the keyboard on this thing is my favorite part of the computer .,1

"they are loud enough to fill a small , quiet room , but that is about it .",0

this battery lasts for 5 + hours on some of the most taxing apps my phone can run .,1

the touchscreen is great and the backlit keyboard is fantastic .,1
asus is a great computer company .,1
"while i hate that it doesn ' t have a caps key , so i have to keep using the shift key to capitalize my letters , the device itself is lightweight , has a very nice backlit keyboard , and works well for the purposes of taking it on the road and using it with wifi at your local coffeeshop .",1

a great chromebook .,1

"the keyboard feels nice to use , the keys have a satisfying travel .",1
